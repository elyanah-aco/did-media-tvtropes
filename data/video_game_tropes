Alternate Identity Amnesia|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateIdentityAmnesia|"This trope is about characters with a form of Involuntary Shapeshifting or Superpowered Evil Side that causes them to suffer amnesia whenever they transform to their alternate form or self. Typically this trope is most often used in media with werewolves (or any other sort of werecreatures), though characters with a Jekyll And Hyde style Split Personality, Demonic Possession, Mind Control, or an Enemy Within may also suffer from this form of amnesia. When it happens it may be immediately noticeable to the character; they will freak out at suffering blackouts and waking up naked in a field, covered in blood, and surrounded by animal carcassesnote(hopefully it'll be just animal carcasses; human body parts are also a distinct possibility).
 In some cases the amnesiac lycanthrope actually suffers a combination of Laser-Guided Amnesia and Weirdness Censor about the Missing Time; they might spend weeks, months or years unaware of their condition. It helps if they transition into a type of ""sleepwalker"" that walks home and cleans up post transformation. The smarter the alternate form is the likelier this is to happen, since it'll likely want its host to stay unawares as long as possible.
 One dangerous possibility is for characters to become a Zombie Infectee who willfully ignores or rationalizes away any evidence, symptoms, and lost memories. Whether they cop to it or not, expect Amnesiac Dissonance to kick in once they feel the weight of their crimes.
 Typically the memories are merely repressed and come back in a Past Experience Nightmare flashback sequence. If the lycanthopy can be controlled, then learning to do so usually enables the character to remember past events as well as remain lucid and in control during future ones. Occasionally the memories really are irrecoverable, usually if the character is essentially comatose while someone/thing else is in control.
 The explanation for the blackouts is usually that ""the wolf"" has taken over and puts the character to sleep or in the passenger's seat. It's worth noting that the alternate identity isn't necessarily hostile to the character note(indeed, they usually depend on them to exist, save for cases where they plan to pull a Split-Personality Takeover) and in these cases both personalities may try desperately to find means to communicate.
 Contrast And I Must Scream, when the lycanthrope is aware of what's going on but helpless to stop their wolf-self. Compare What Did I Do Last Night?, the alcohol-induced version. Compare The Killer in Me, especially the ""Amnesiac Killer"" type. Compare Trauma-Induced Amnesia, which is also fairly common in disassociative disorders. Compare also Identity Amnesia and Amnesiac Dissonance.
 This is probably the most ""realistic"" presentation of classic multiple personality/dissociative identity disorder  the individual identities may not be aware of the existence or experiences of the other identities, and consequently suffer from time disturbances. It's one of the most frightening things about Real Life multiplicity, especially considering its use in this trope, to the point of stereotype. People in real life who know they're multiple may not come out even to close friends, fearing it's the first thing that'll come to mind. Amnesia is also not true for all real-life multiples across the board, and if someone tells you they do know what their other selves said and did, they are likely telling you the truth. Today's psychotherapy for multiples focuses not on fusion but on communication. Many have worked out their own system, leaving notes or voicemails for one another."|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSims1|Happens to Werewolf sims.|The Sims|2000|VideoGame

Enemy Within|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyWithin|"A specific form of Split Personality. Maybe the Body Horror became a bit too fused with someone. Maybe the Unstoppable Rage is getting... too unstoppable. Perhaps The Atoner's past is taking on a life of its own. A half-human's Demon / Vampire self is trying to take control, or that Deal with the Devil is hitting a bit too close to home.
 Either way, the enemy is behind the hero's eyes, and its time is coming when it can take over. Until then, it'll do all it can to control him and get him to give in to its Horror Hunger. The thing to stress most is that the Enemy Within is the hero. He or she cannot simply exorcise it out. Often the Enemy Within is the cause of the powers that the hero has that allows them to do what they do. With Great Power Comes Great Insanity, remember?
 Often, since Evil Is Cool and Evil Feels Good, other characters may realize the danger before the hero and need to convince him.
 This trope has received criticism from the mental health community, as it is accused of demonising patients with Dissociative Identity Disorder (or DID), and being seen as one of the reasons for stigmatization against people with DID due to its constant use in media. This was most notably seen in the backlash against Split (2016), whose potrayal of DID was seen by many to be VERY damaging.
 Not to be confused with the expansion pack to the X-Com reboot, nor an unrelated TV series, or another unrelated novel. Contrast Enemy Without. Compare Jekyll & Hyde. Also not to be confused with Kill It Through Its Stomach, which involves an enemy literally inside another.

Enemy Without|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyWithout|"When someone's inner darkness doesn't quite take over someone, but it does ""escape"" their body and rampage. Fighting someone else's Enemy Without is tricky, as often it will either kill the person projecting it if it dies, or it will just resurrect itself until the actual darkness in the hero's heart is dealt with by the hero themselves.
 Often symbolically represents repression, and the hero's refusal to acknowledge the darkness within or some other aspect of themselves. Victory is achieved half the time via ""reintegrating"" with it. The other half of of the time it can be seen as representing some inner demon, and thus, it must be abandoned, purged, or confronted and conquered.
 Sometimes this battle will occur inside someone's own head in a dreamscape, making it both the Enemy Within and the Enemy Without at the same time. It may require saying ""I'm Not Afraid of You!"" to weaken it enough to beat.
 This trope is very similar to The Heartless, Made of Evil, and Literal Split Personality. It is distinguished from The Heartless by having some personal connection to the person/people it was created from, from Made of Evil because the Enemy may be flesh and bone, and from Literal Split Personality by leaving behind a clearly-defined original character.

 But the effect on their body is just a fringe benefit to the effect on their mind. Their conscience just shuts up. They're free to break all the rules, do anything they want. No more scruples, no morals, no inhibitors to hold them back from tearing their arch enemy to shreds. And it feels good.
 Often a motivation for For the Evulz, although For the Evulz doesn't have to involve the character even enjoying the evil they do  they just do it because it's evil.

Evil Twin|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin|"Two family members (who happen to look identical) who are moral opposites of one another. Typically done with literal twins, these characters are of the same generation, but may have been raised as ""cousins"", or even completely separated from one another. It's especially popular in a Soap Opera, where they can use an Identical Twin Mistake to wreak havoc with their Good Twin's life.
 Typically the evil twin will be portrayed by the same actor as the regular character. It's worth noting that in the overwhelming majority of cases the twin is evil; only rarely does an evil character suddenly find themselves contending with a good twin, and in those cases the good version is often simpleminded or purely comic. See Good Is Impotent and Impersonating the Evil Twin.
 The evil twin may attempt to convince their good twin that they aren't so different, saying We Can Rule Together and that the good twin's friends are holding them back from greatness. This often ends with a Mirror Match as neither one will be able to convince the other of their ideology. After the fight, their allies will usually need to Spot the Imposter to figure out who won.
 A goatee or other beard is less common for Evil Twins than they are for typical Evil Counterpart examples, because it distorts the use of Always Identical Twins. However, other Identical Twin ID Tag tropes are still used to differentiate between the good/evil twins, such as scars and evil costuming. Very often, one twin will be right-handed and the other left-handed. Guess which one's which.
 This trope is Played for Laughs when both twins are evil, or when a character on the side of the good guys has a good twin show up, implying that the original is the evil one. Sub-Trope of Always Identical Twins (siblings are Doppelgangers), Evil Counterpart (any evil Foil to a character), and Evil Doppelgnger (someone who is both a Doppelgnger and Evil Counterpart). Sister Trope to Evil Knockoff (intentionally created evil duplicate), Cain and Abel (non-twin siblings where one is good and the other is evil), and Criminal Doppelgnger (evil Identical Stranger). Super-Trope to Evil Brunette Twin, where the Always Identical Twins have different hair colours (and the darker one is evil).

 The evil twin may attempt to convince their good twin that they aren't so different, saying We Can Rule Together and that the good twin's friends are holding them back from greatness.

However, other Identical Twin ID Tag tropes are still used to differentiate between the good/evil twins, such as scars and evil costuming. Very often, one twin will be right-handed and the other left-handed. Guess which one's which.
 This trope is Played for Laughs when both twins are evil, or when a character on the side of the good guys has a good twin show up, implying that the original is the evil one. Sub-Trope of Always Identical Twins (siblings are Doppelgangers), Evil Counterpart (any evil Foil to a character), and Evil Doppelgnger (someone who is both a Doppelgnger and Evil Counterpart).

Yes, this includes the steel pipe and the submachine gun. Despite her bloody and rotten appearance, though, the ""evil"" part is downplayed since her reasons for trying to kill Heather are  to prevent the God's birth and spare Heather and the world from the endless suffering that will come if the God is birthed."|Silent Hill 3|2003|VideoGame
Evil Twin|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin|"Two family members (who happen to look identical) who are moral opposites of one another. Typically done with literal twins, these characters are of the same generation, but may have been raised as ""cousins"", or even completely separated from one another. It's especially popular in a Soap Opera, where they can use an Identical Twin Mistake to wreak havoc with their Good Twin's life.
 Typically the evil twin will be portrayed by the same actor as the regular character. It's worth noting that in the overwhelming majority of cases the twin is evil; only rarely does an evil character suddenly find themselves contending with a good twin, and in those cases the good version is often simpleminded or purely comic. See Good Is Impotent and Impersonating the Evil Twin.
 The evil twin may attempt to convince their good twin that they aren't so different, saying We Can Rule Together and that the good twin's friends are holding them back from greatness. This often ends with a Mirror Match as neither one will be able to convince the other of their ideology. After the fight, their allies will usually need to Spot the Imposter to figure out who won.
 A goatee or other beard is less common for Evil Twins than they are for typical Evil Counterpart examples, because it distorts the use of Always Identical Twins. However, other Identical Twin ID Tag tropes are still used to differentiate between the good/evil twins, such as scars and evil costuming. Very often, one twin will be right-handed and the other left-handed. Guess which one's which.

 The evil twin may attempt to convince their good twin that they aren't so different, saying We Can Rule Together and that the good twin's friends are holding them back from greatness.

 Insane  Bob's completely lost his mind, but how can we make that plain to the audience? Simple  Have him mention hearing voices in his head, or depict him conversing with them. Closely related to Split Personality. If Bob is a telepath suffering from Power Incontinence, the voices may actually be the cause of his madness, rather than a symptom.
 Evil  The evil version can come from a lot of sources. Demonic Possession, nearby ghosts, Artifacts of Doom and Tomes of Eldritch Lore. The Demon/Spirit/Artifact(s) possessing Bob may serve as the ""evil"" shoulder angel, and rather than (or in addition to) forcing him to do evil, tells him to. As Bob realizes Evil Feels Good, the demon can then claim that it didn't make Bob do anything he didn't want to.

 Good  The voices come from a higher power, often God or angels. Rather than compel Bob to go on a killing spree, they'll offer him guidance, and likely encourage pacifism. Or cause him to become a Knight Templar...
 Chaotic Neutral  It's often unknown where the voices are coming from, whether the source is holy, unholy, or neutral is never delved into. Or even Maybe Magic, Maybe Mundane. Alternatively, the voices come from a multitude of sources, some good, some evil.

 Insane  Bob's completely lost his mind, but how can we make that plain to the audience? Simple  Have him mention hearing voices in his head, or depict him conversing with them. Closely related to Split Personality. If Bob is a telepath suffering from Power Incontinence, the voices may actually be the cause of his madness, rather than a symptom.
 Evil  The evil version can come from a lot of sources. Demonic Possession, nearby ghosts, Artifacts of Doom and Tomes of Eldritch Lore. The Demon/Spirit/Artifact(s) possessing Bob may serve as the ""evil"" shoulder angel, and rather than (or in addition to) forcing him to do evil, tells him to. As Bob realizes Evil Feels Good, the demon can then claim that it didn't make Bob do anything he didn't want to.
 Thanks to a deal with Trope Co., for an unlimited time, we've got two new flavors, Sour Good and Mystery flavor. Except in Nebraska, something about Trope Co. and several hundred liters of Psycho Serum.
 Good  The voices come from a higher power, often God or angels. Rather than compel Bob to go on a killing spree, they'll offer him guidance, and likely encourage pacifism. Or cause him to become a Knight Templar...

Heroic Safe Mode|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSafeMode|"Heroism is hazardous work for both the body and the mind: it's fairly common for heroes to end up facing at least one emotionally, mentally, or psychically charged event capable of causing a Heroic Blue Screen Of Death that temporarily renders them catatonic. Of course, this wouldn't be a gripping New York Times Best Seller if it didn't happen at the worst possible time to ramp up the tension as the audience is left hoping the Side Kick can protect the hero until he or she snaps out of it.
 Keeping the computing metaphor, some heroes have a heartier Operating System than the norm, which when faced with the Heroic BSoD instead enters Heroic Safe Mode. During this period the hero ""shuts down"" non-essential thought processes and focuses entirely on ""fight or flight"", hoping that when the danger is over they can ""restart"" in safety. Especially strong-willed heroes who go into Safe Mode while loved ones are in danger will usually protect them to near-suicidal extremes. In other cases, they may wind up snapping at their own friends who try to push them out of Safe Mode. Luckily, these loved ones can usually push the restart button with a Cooldown Hug. They will (at best) talk in monosyllables, become either completely emotionless or absolutely enraged, but they will always, always terrify friend and foe alike with an unfiltered Death Glare. When a hero fully reboots from this mode back into their standard operating procedure, Post-Victory Collapse usually kicks in, or the full-on Heroic BSoD may kick in after the direct danger to the hero and/or their companions has passed. It is often seen as the good counterpart of a Villainous Breakdown.
 Where this gets interesting is if the hero has a Split Personality or Adaptive Armor that is not normally in the driver's seat. With the hero ""out to lunch"", the passenger may decide to take survival into his, her or its own hands (neurons?) and control their body until the hero is well again. This varies depending on the nature of the Split Personality. For example, a soul-bound Empathic Weapon might default to Attack! Attack! Attack!, while a more evil Enemy Within might decide it's a good time to unlock the hero's Superpowered Evil Side.
 Once they reboot, they may well regret having not helped save someone, run away, or killed many dozens of mooks... but as friends will remind him, at least he (and they) are still alive.
 This is Truth in Television to a greater degree than a lot of Split Personality Tropes. Many traumatized people deal with their pain by creating a kind of secondary self who is less bothered by the pain because this self is just observing while ""that other self"" is actually experiencing the pain. This function may be one reason for the existence of the Real Life, non-Hollywood Psychology phenomenon of people who have a Split Personality. And people who are multiple in real life and usually operate as a Split-Personality Team may find that in a high-stress situation, some calmer or more competent individual may shove their way to the front and remain there for the duration.
 In a less extreme form, it is considered a healthy coping mechanism. People using this strategy to deal with dangerous or otherwise overwhelming situations will often say to themselves something like, ""I have to focus on survival right now. I'll deal with these feelings later."" This is different from repression because the person is not trying to forget or suppress emotions, only to delay dealing with them until it's safe to do so. People capable of shifting focus away from their own emotions, without suppressing them, are often very resilient; so this is a trait often seen in characters whose professions often take them into emotionally charged situations  soldiers, emergency workers, spies, police, superheroes, and similar.

 In most cases, the character has simply lost their memories, no longer remembering their name, loved ones or where they came from. This is often the cause for a Quest for Identity.
 Sometimes, however, it is their personality that has changed. Not only do they not remember who they were, they are convinced that they are someone else entirely. In essence, Bob doesn't just forget that he's Bob, but he thinks he's Alice instead...
 The affected character may have additional amnesia on top of their personality change, but it's not a guarantee. It's possible they may still know everything they did prior to the switch, except that they've never before acted the way they're acting now. Attempts to get them to remember previous life-defining events that may snap them out of it are likely to be met with a stern dismissal: ""Why do you keep talking about this ""Bob"" guy?!

Dissociative amnesia can also parallel this trope, but also under very rare and extreme circumstances.
 Clinical identity amnesia is the inability to identify with things you have done or said. You still remember who you are, but have no memory of having done certain things. You're just as likely (or more) to disown good deeds as bad ones.

The Killer in Me|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheKillerInMe|"A character (usually the main character, but sometimes sharing equal billing) is chasing or being chased by a killer or monster. A lot of people end up dead, but not this character, and in the end we find out why: the ""hero"" was the villain all along.
 The Amnesiac Killer is the more common variation, primarily because it's easier to write, as the audience is taken through the same reveal as the character himself. The Secretive Killer is particularly hard to pull off with the main protagonist (a minor protagonist is more commonly used for this reason) since the audience is always told the story from their perspective. If the events are shown directly, maintaining the twist right until the end therefore runs the risk of either Out Of Character Moments or losing focus on the character to conceal their real identity. A reliable method is to have the events (re)told through an Unreliable Narrator.
 In many cases, the Amnesiac Killer is essentially a Memory Gambit told In Medias Res. A Split Personality is common; see Alternate Identity Amnesia. This trope could be the result of a HeelFace Brainwashing. In Speculative Fiction, this may be due to a Superpowered Evil Side or Enemy Within.
 When handled with care, it can be a powerful Twist Ending. When tacked on just for the sake of surprising the audience, however, it is likely that key events in the story will become illogical, or in the worst case, physically impossible.
 Compare Tomato in the Mirror, in which the character finds out some other truth about who or what they are.

 The Amnesiac Killer is the more common variation, primarily because it's easier to write, as the audience is taken through the same reveal as the character himself. The Secretive Killer is particularly hard to pull off with the main protagonist (a minor protagonist is more commonly used for this reason) since the audience is always told the story from their perspective.

Multi-Gendered Split Personalities|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiGenderedSplitPersonalities|"Split Personalities are weird things. They can have completely opposing personality traits to the main personality, different skills sometimes... But perhaps one of the oddest from a logical standpoint is when a split personality is actually a different gender from the main personality and from the body they control.
 How exactly they rationalize this gender incongruity can vary and tends to depend on Alternate Identity Amnesia. Some may see their own body as fitting their perceived sex. Some may simply ignore it. Some may consider themselves transgender. Some may believe their body was physically changed when they were unconscious (which the audience may be led to believe as well). Every mental coping mechanism will be a brain-twister, however.
 Mixing in actual forms of Gender Bender can add a new layer of complexity: A personality fronting may involve an extreme Split-Personality Makeover where the body changes sex to match them. Conversely, when The Mind Is a Plaything of the Body, the dysphoria brought on by a transformation can cause dissociated identities of different gender. And this is without getting into opposite sex individuals that ended up Sharing a Body.

Sexier Alter Ego|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexierAlterEgo|"This trope is for characters of any gender that have an alternate form or identity that is much sexier than their normal mode. It's not necessarily because their ""civilian"" mode is ugly, but it is generally more mundane or otherwise less appealing than their ""heroic"" mode. Depending on the genre, the changes can be accomplished through either regular means such as acting and swapping wardrobes or though various magical or phlebotinum-driven methods. This usually involves a change in a character's physical appearance, but sometimes it's purely a change in personality traits and behavior, suggesting that the character in question is deliberately making themselves appear unattractive to hide their Secret Identity.
 Given that sexual attractiveness is subjective, the best examples are those when the sexier nature of the alternate form is shown from the perspective of another character reacting to them with subtle flirting and innuendo that otherwise wouldn't be present. That said, it's generally pretty clear when the creators of the story are trying to change someone from Hollywood Homely (or even downright ugly) into Ms. Fanservice or a Head-Turning Beauty.
 This often overlaps with Split Personality, Shapeshifting, Older Alter Ego, and Superpowered Alter Ego.
 Compare A Darker Me. Compare also to Shapeshifting Seducer where a shapeshifter capable of assuming many forms takes on several in an attempt to appeal to a specific person. She Cleans Up Nicely should be used for when a character changes from their usually dull or unattractive wardrobe, hairstyle and such to be more attractive (particularly at a formal event) however this new appearance is not associated with an alter ego or alternate physical form. Also see Evil Is Sexy.

Shadow Archetype|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShadowArchetype|"Shadow Archetype has to do with two elements of writing: characters and settings. In this article we discuss character archetypes. For the settings viewpoint, see Shadowland.
 Character-wise, it's the part of the personality that embodies everything a character, called the 'Self', doesn't like about themselves, the things they (often subconsciously) deny about themselves and project on to others. In fact, the more the Shadow has been repressed, the more powerful it becomes. To show these things to the audience we need an embodiment of some sort.
 Around here, we call some of those embodiments things like:
 Those tropes have examples listed of characters playing those more-precise Shadow roles that often overlap with this but do not have to.
 A common trope involves the Self accepting their Shadow, metaphorically coming to terms with their flaw (see I Am What I Am). That is, The Hero refuses to kill the Shadow, given the opportunity, or outright refuses to fight it. In Enemy Within, Enemy Without, and Evil Twin situations, the Self and Shadow sometimes even merge towards the end for an endgame powerup, further emphasizing the symbolism.

Probably an allusion to her past self as The Cunning and Treacherous Oni, from Wild and Horned Hermit."|Touhou Hyouibana ~ Antinomy of Common Flowers|2017|VideoGame
Shadow Archetype|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShadowArchetype|"Shadow Archetype has to do with two elements of writing: characters and settings. In this article we discuss character archetypes. For the settings viewpoint, see Shadowland.
 Character-wise, it's the part of the personality that embodies everything a character, called the 'Self', doesn't like about themselves, the things they (often subconsciously) deny about themselves and project on to others. In fact, the more the Shadow has been repressed, the more powerful it becomes. To show these things to the audience we need an embodiment of some sort.
 Around here, we call some of those embodiments things like:
 Those tropes have examples listed of characters playing those more-precise Shadow roles that often overlap with this but do not have to.
 A common trope involves the Self accepting their Shadow, metaphorically coming to terms with their flaw (see I Am What I Am). That is, The Hero refuses to kill the Shadow, given the opportunity, or outright refuses to fight it. In Enemy Within, Enemy Without, and Evil Twin situations, the Self and Shadow sometimes even merge towards the end for an endgame powerup, further emphasizing the symbolism.

Kim Kitsuragi is a highly logical Consummate Professional who disregards the insane ramblings of the insane people around him, with Authority off the charts - but he can play along with these antics if it gets him an edge. This isn't too far off from a Logical, Boring Cop high in Morale who ignores the stupid shit his brain has to say to him. Garte is an asshole trying to hide his fuckups and constantly irritated at the world falling to pieces around him, and eventually figures out he's not afraid of death after doing something monumentally stupid. He also has a tendency to claim he doesn't care for people; it's implied one of the reasons Harry joined the RCM was because he gave a shit, and with high enough Empathy, Harry can note Garte really WAS trying to protect the rest of the people inside the hostel as best as he could. Idiot Doom Spiral changes his background on a dime, makes bullshit up (and also hides the fact his downfall likely hinged on things besides his keys), pushes people away, and is powered on alcohol. One of Harry's thoughts sarcastically notes that this chain of events couldn't have happened to a nicer guy. Rene Arnoux is a spitfire, but frail fascist holding on to the glory days, his long-dead lover, and calling everyone he doesn't like a communist. This isn't unlike a Fascist Harry who romanticises the past, especially that bit about his lover, and Harries with very low PHYS are heavily implied to die soon after the events of the game, if not during it. Whatever your choices, Rene dies on Day Five, stubbornly trying to do his job. Klaasje's a drug-addicted mess who is still very, very good at what she does - not far off from cops with high Electrochemistry, or Harry before the amnesia. In addition, the ID you find is implied to be her real ID, but using an outdated photo - just like Harry's. Evrart Claire is fond of saying stupid shit, playing along with the stupid shit of other people, mocking people to their faces, and dealing in corrupt bargaining. This is all in service to a genuine goal and idea, especially for Communist Cops, and especially for players who were able to get the Hardie Boys to talk. Measurehead is a meathead who believes in extremely illogical race ideas and enforcing them with force. - which a Harry who believes in racism, nationalism, strength, and stupid things like The Remote Viewers' Division can believe in, too. Alain is all too eager to prod back at you, and it's clear it's to try and get people to expose themselves, similar to what Harry was like as ""the Human Can Opener"", talking to get people to overextend themselves and reveal weaknesses. Post-Tribunal, he can very likely end up like Harry and Ellis: a sorry, guilt-ridden drunken mess of a man who'll die soon, either at his own hands or due to his antics. It takes a lot of talking and bonding, but Joyce Messier is, deep down, just like Harry. She longs for her past and is implied to long for a romance she had in Martinaise, just like Harry and ""her"". Even Boring Cops will have their brains talk to them to encourage them to do dumb shit - and Joyce's admission that her sanity is just a mask isn't that far off from the justification a Boring Cop can use. Both of them avoid talking about the pale, with the implication that they've both been exposed to it for too long, and that the both of them know there's not enough time left - either for the world, or for their sanity. If you suss this out, you two can share a knowing goodbye before she leaves. Who's the Crab Man? A middle-aged man involved in an everyday trade who suddenly began a violent downward spiral and came out the other side babbling about nonsense and worshipping ""her"", due to pale exposure. The Hanged Man has all the facets of every possible Harry. He was a violent drug addict threatening to kill everyone and everything in the name of racism, political ideas, or even because he can, just like Harry. He was in a slow, destructive, world-ending spiral prior to the game beginning, just like Harry. Despite his flaws, he attracted a woman who saw past his tough exterior and left him all the same, just like Harry. Art Cops will note Raul claims Lely dabbled in the arts. Human Can Openers will hear Raul say that if Lely was here, he could have talked them all down, despite everything pointing to failure - not unlike Harry being able to open up a blustering Titus and his Boys with only a few words. Apocalypse Cops will heed the fact that his drunken, genocidal ramblings about the world coming to an end sound quite a lot like theirs - on top of the fact it's HEAVILY implied both Lely and Harry were screaming into tape recorders the night of the murder. Druggie Cops will be pleased to hear that he loved his booze and drugs to drown out the world and loved the ladies, too. Corrupt Cops will empathise with the fact his unit worked for the just-as-corrupt Oranjese megacorps. And if you take the bad thing that happened at the Church that involved Harry at face value, you're potentially an atrocity-committing wreck, just like the Hanged Man leading the horrific violation and murder of a Semenese woman. Speaking of The Hanged Man, the rest of his unit qualifies. de Paule was one of the mercs investigating after the murder and uses every piece of evidence available in the encounter. When she first speaks, the narrator notes she is oddly stoic. She's not far off from Kim in these regards. Ruud is an incomprensible, sorry mountain of a man. If you have high perception, it's heavily implied his whispering is him quoting literature - not far off from an Art Cop or someone with high Inland Empire - and is heavily implied to have been grieving Lely's death by drinking himself to near death, not unlike Harry's decades-long attempted suicide after ""she"" left. Raul can further reveal Ruud was one of the most brutal people on the unit. So was Harry in his Precinct. The Deserter, a violent communist all too eager to blame everything on the ""ruling class"" and kill them, too. What's more is that it's implied he can hear not only La Revacholiere like a Harry who has, but also other Cryptids like a Harry who ascribes to the Col Do Ma Ma Daqua Cryptid, and, finally, a devil figure - Iblis. ""Shaitan"". The total opposite of the Messianic Dolores Dei. During the ending, Jean will compare you and him to Torson and McLaine, two cowboy cops who're ""an iconic duo"" like you two - except Jean will quickly point out you two are iconic for being clinically depressed men, and they are not. Kim Kitsuragi is a highly logical Consummate Professional who disregards the insane ramblings of the insane people around him, with Authority off the charts - but he can play along with these antics if it gets him an edge. This isn't too far off from a Logical, Boring Cop high in Morale who ignores the stupid shit his brain has to say to him.

Split Personality|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonality|"A character's mind is split between two or more personalities. Usually, these personalities will have distinct traits, motivations, and memories. They may or may not be able to interact with one another (or even be aware of each other's existence). Control over the character's mind and body will often switch between these personalities against their will, causing problems for both themself and everyone around them.
 Fictional split personalities can be similar to a real-life condition, Dissociative Identity Disorder (or DID). DID is a mental disorder in which more than one distinct personality can be observed at different times within a single individual's brain, often associated with extreme long-term childhood trauma. The individual has no control over when their personalities ""switch"", and may not remember what they did or what happened to them while another personality was active (dissociative amnesia). DID has often been mischaracterized in the media, and its status remains controversial to this day.
 Split personalities have been represented in many different ways over the years. Though characters with such conditions are surprisingly common in fiction, most of them don't match the textbook definitions of DID. The most common case shown is where two (or more) personalities switch with one another; some depictions show people experiencing life as one person (i.e. having the same mind, memory and desires) but with modes of behavior that switch between distinct states.
 The most common usage of split personalities is a Jekyll & Hyde scenario, where a person has a ""good"" personality, and a ""bad"" one. Switching between these personalities might be signified by visual changes. The ""good"" personality may have trouble controlling the ""bad"" one, which may come out at inopportune times, bully the ""good"" personality into cooperating, or try to take over entirely. If theyre lucky, the character may be able to merge their personalities back together, allowing them to function as a single (and usually greater) mind.

Part of the difficulty of dealing with Gahan is that Evil Gahan will often pretend to be Good Gahan so that he can mock you and steal one of your items after you give him one. The way to tell the two apart is to look at the direction their feet are pointing and listen to the noise Gahan makes when he appears; if it makes a high pitched shuddering noise, Good Gahan's feet point to your right, Evil Gahan's feet point to your left. If he makes a low warbling noise, the reverse is true.|The Ultimate Haunted House|1993|VideoGame
Split Personality|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonality|"A character's mind is split between two or more personalities. Usually, these personalities will have distinct traits, motivations, and memories. They may or may not be able to interact with one another (or even be aware of each other's existence). Control over the character's mind and body will often switch between these personalities against their will, causing problems for both themself and everyone around them.
 Fictional split personalities can be similar to a real-life condition, Dissociative Identity Disorder (or DID). DID is a mental disorder in which more than one distinct personality can be observed at different times within a single individual's brain, often associated with extreme long-term childhood trauma. The individual has no control over when their personalities ""switch"", and may not remember what they did or what happened to them while another personality was active (dissociative amnesia). DID has often been mischaracterized in the media, and its status remains controversial to this day.
 Split personalities have been represented in many different ways over the years. Though characters with such conditions are surprisingly common in fiction, most of them don't match the textbook definitions of DID. The most common case shown is where two (or more) personalities switch with one another; some depictions show people experiencing life as one person (i.e. having the same mind, memory and desires) but with modes of behavior that switch between distinct states.
 The most common usage of split personalities is a Jekyll & Hyde scenario, where a person has a ""good"" personality, and a ""bad"" one. Switching between these personalities might be signified by visual changes. The ""good"" personality may have trouble controlling the ""bad"" one, which may come out at inopportune times, bully the ""good"" personality into cooperating, or try to take over entirely. If theyre lucky, the character may be able to merge their personalities back together, allowing them to function as a single (and usually greater) mind.
 Compare and contrast with Double Consciousness, Mind Hive, Sharing a Body, Two Beings, One Body, and Talking to Themself. May overlap with Identity Amnesia. Also compare Many Spirits Inside of One, where a person is possessed by multiple independent spirits; and Napoleon Delusion, where a person falsely believes their body is inhabited by the spirit of a famous figure. When this happens to a superhero, it's often a Superpowered Evil Side. Shapeshifting is sometimes involved. If the personalities go back and forth, Flip Personality ensues.
 If the two personalities are aware of each other, expect a Gollum Made Me Do It situation to develop. Resolving it may require the weaker of the two to say ""I'm Not Afraid of You!""

Split Personality|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonality|"A character's mind is split between two or more personalities. Usually, these personalities will have distinct traits, motivations, and memories. They may or may not be able to interact with one another (or even be aware of each other's existence). Control over the character's mind and body will often switch between these personalities against their will, causing problems for both themself and everyone around them.
 Fictional split personalities can be similar to a real-life condition, Dissociative Identity Disorder (or DID). DID is a mental disorder in which more than one distinct personality can be observed at different times within a single individual's brain, often associated with extreme long-term childhood trauma. The individual has no control over when their personalities ""switch"", and may not remember what they did or what happened to them while another personality was active (dissociative amnesia). DID has often been mischaracterized in the media, and its status remains controversial to this day.

Split Personality|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonality|"A character's mind is split between two or more personalities. Usually, these personalities will have distinct traits, motivations, and memories. They may or may not be able to interact with one another (or even be aware of each other's existence). Control over the character's mind and body will often switch between these personalities against their will, causing problems for both themself and everyone around them.
 Fictional split personalities can be similar to a real-life condition, Dissociative Identity Disorder (or DID). DID is a mental disorder in which more than one distinct personality can be observed at different times within a single individual's brain, often associated with extreme long-term childhood trauma. The individual has no control over when their personalities ""switch"", and may not remember what they did or what happened to them while another personality was active (dissociative amnesia). DID has often been mischaracterized in the media, and its status remains controversial to this day.
 Split personalities have been represented in many different ways over the years. Though characters with such conditions are surprisingly common in fiction, most of them don't match the textbook definitions of DID. The most common case shown is where two (or more) personalities switch with one another; some depictions show people experiencing life as one person (i.e. having the same mind, memory and desires) but with modes of behavior that switch between distinct states.
 The most common usage of split personalities is a Jekyll & Hyde scenario, where a person has a ""good"" personality, and a ""bad"" one. Switching between these personalities might be signified by visual changes. The ""good"" personality may have trouble controlling the ""bad"" one, which may come out at inopportune times, bully the ""good"" personality into cooperating, or try to take over entirely. If theyre lucky, the character may be able to merge their personalities back together, allowing them to function as a single (and usually greater) mind.
 Compare and contrast with Double Consciousness, Mind Hive, Sharing a Body, Two Beings, One Body, and Talking to Themself. May overlap with Identity Amnesia. Also compare Many Spirits Inside of One, where a person is possessed by multiple independent spirits; and Napoleon Delusion, where a person falsely believes their body is inhabited by the spirit of a famous figure. When this happens to a superhero, it's often a Superpowered Evil Side. Shapeshifting is sometimes involved. If the personalities go back and forth, Flip Personality ensues.
 If the two personalities are aware of each other, expect a Gollum Made Me Do It situation to develop. Resolving it may require the weaker of the two to say ""I'm Not Afraid of You!"" If the Split Personality gets its own body it becomes either a Literal Split Personality or Enemy Without (if said personality is antagonistic or evil).

Split Personality|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonality|"A character's mind is split between two or more personalities. Usually, these personalities will have distinct traits, motivations, and memories. They may or may not be able to interact with one another (or even be aware of each other's existence). Control over the character's mind and body will often switch between these personalities against their will, causing problems for both themself and everyone around them.
 Fictional split personalities can be similar to a real-life condition, Dissociative Identity Disorder (or DID). DID is a mental disorder in which more than one distinct personality can be observed at different times within a single individual's brain, often associated with extreme long-term childhood trauma. The individual has no control over when their personalities ""switch"", and may not remember what they did or what happened to them while another personality was active (dissociative amnesia). DID has often been mischaracterized in the media, and its status remains controversial to this day.
 Split personalities have been represented in many different ways over the years. Though characters with such conditions are surprisingly common in fiction, most of them don't match the textbook definitions of DID. The most common case shown is where two (or more) personalities switch with one another; some depictions show people experiencing life as one person (i.e. having the same mind, memory and desires) but with modes of behavior that switch between distinct states.
 The most common usage of split personalities is a Jekyll & Hyde scenario, where a person has a ""good"" personality, and a ""bad"" one.

Usually, these personalities will have distinct traits, motivations, and memories. They may or may not be able to interact with one another (or even be aware of each other's existence). Control over the character's mind and body will often switch between these personalities against their will, causing problems for both themself and everyone around them.
 Fictional split personalities can be similar to a real-life condition, Dissociative Identity Disorder (or DID). DID is a mental disorder in which more than one distinct personality can be observed at different times within a single individual's brain, often associated with extreme long-term childhood trauma. The individual has no control over when their personalities ""switch"", and may not remember what they did or what happened to them while another personality was active (dissociative amnesia). DID has often been mischaracterized in the media, and its status remains controversial to this day.
 Split personalities have been represented in many different ways over the years. Though characters with such conditions are surprisingly common in fiction, most of them don't match the textbook definitions of DID. The most common case shown is where two (or more) personalities switch with one another; some depictions show people experiencing life as one person (i.e. having the same mind, memory and desires) but with modes of behavior that switch between distinct states.
 The most common usage of split personalities is a Jekyll & Hyde scenario, where a person has a ""good"" personality, and a ""bad"" one. Switching between these personalities might be signified by visual changes. The ""good"" personality may have trouble controlling the ""bad"" one, which may come out at inopportune times, bully the ""good"" personality into cooperating, or try to take over entirely. If theyre lucky, the character may be able to merge their personalities back together, allowing them to function as a single (and usually greater) mind.
 Compare and contrast with Double Consciousness, Mind Hive, Sharing a Body, Two Beings, One Body, and Talking to Themself. May overlap with Identity Amnesia. Also compare Many Spirits Inside of One, where a person is possessed by multiple independent spirits; and Napoleon Delusion, where a person falsely believes their body is inhabited by the spirit of a famous figure. When this happens to a superhero, it's often a Superpowered Evil Side. Shapeshifting is sometimes involved. If the personalities go back and forth, Flip Personality ensues.
 If the two personalities are aware of each other, expect a Gollum Made Me Do It situation to develop. Resolving it may require the weaker of the two to say ""I'm Not Afraid of You!"" If the Split Personality gets its own body it becomes either a Literal Split Personality or Enemy Without (if said personality is antagonistic or evil).

Split Personality|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonality|"A character's mind is split between two or more personalities. Usually, these personalities will have distinct traits, motivations, and memories. They may or may not be able to interact with one another (or even be aware of each other's existence). Control over the character's mind and body will often switch between these personalities against their will, causing problems for both themself and everyone around them.
 Fictional split personalities can be similar to a real-life condition, Dissociative Identity Disorder (or DID). DID is a mental disorder in which more than one distinct personality can be observed at different times within a single individual's brain, often associated with extreme long-term childhood trauma. The individual has no control over when their personalities ""switch"", and may not remember what they did or what happened to them while another personality was active (dissociative amnesia). DID has often been mischaracterized in the media, and its status remains controversial to this day.
 Split personalities have been represented in many different ways over the years. Though characters with such conditions are surprisingly common in fiction, most of them don't match the textbook definitions of DID. The most common case shown is where two (or more) personalities switch with one another; some depictions show people experiencing life as one person (i.e. having the same mind, memory and desires) but with modes of behavior that switch between distinct states.
 The most common usage of split personalities is a Jekyll & Hyde scenario, where a person has a ""good"" personality, and a ""bad"" one. Switching between these personalities might be signified by visual changes. The ""good"" personality may have trouble controlling the ""bad"" one, which may come out at inopportune times, bully the ""good"" personality into cooperating, or try to take over entirely.

 Fictional split personalities can be similar to a real-life condition, Dissociative Identity Disorder (or DID). DID is a mental disorder in which more than one distinct personality can be observed at different times within a single individual's brain, often associated with extreme long-term childhood trauma. The individual has no control over when their personalities ""switch"", and may not remember what they did or what happened to them while another personality was active (dissociative amnesia). DID has often been mischaracterized in the media, and its status remains controversial to this day.
 Split personalities have been represented in many different ways over the years. Though characters with such conditions are surprisingly common in fiction, most of them don't match the textbook definitions of DID. The most common case shown is where two (or more) personalities switch with one another; some depictions show people experiencing life as one person (i.e. having the same mind, memory and desires) but with modes of behavior that switch between distinct states.
 The most common usage of split personalities is a Jekyll & Hyde scenario, where a person has a ""good"" personality, and a ""bad"" one. Switching between these personalities might be signified by visual changes. The ""good"" personality may have trouble controlling the ""bad"" one, which may come out at inopportune times, bully the ""good"" personality into cooperating, or try to take over entirely. If theyre lucky, the character may be able to merge their personalities back together, allowing them to function as a single (and usually greater) mind.

Also compare Many Spirits Inside of One, where a person is possessed by multiple independent spirits; and Napoleon Delusion, where a person falsely believes their body is inhabited by the spirit of a famous figure. When this happens to a superhero, it's often a Superpowered Evil Side. Shapeshifting is sometimes involved. If the personalities go back and forth, Flip Personality ensues.
 If the two personalities are aware of each other, expect a Gollum Made Me Do It situation to develop. Resolving it may require the weaker of the two to say ""I'm Not Afraid of You!""

Split Personality|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonality|"A character's mind is split between two or more personalities. Usually, these personalities will have distinct traits, motivations, and memories. They may or may not be able to interact with one another (or even be aware of each other's existence). Control over the character's mind and body will often switch between these personalities against their will, causing problems for both themself and everyone around them.
 Fictional split personalities can be similar to a real-life condition, Dissociative Identity Disorder (or DID). DID is a mental disorder in which more than one distinct personality can be observed at different times within a single individual's brain, often associated with extreme long-term childhood trauma. The individual has no control over when their personalities ""switch"", and may not remember what they did or what happened to them while another personality was active (dissociative amnesia). DID has often been mischaracterized in the media, and its status remains controversial to this day.
 Split personalities have been represented in many different ways over the years. Though characters with such conditions are surprisingly common in fiction, most of them don't match the textbook definitions of DID. The most common case shown is where two (or more) personalities switch with one another; some depictions show people experiencing life as one person (i.e. having the same mind, memory and desires) but with modes of behavior that switch between distinct states.
 The most common usage of split personalities is a Jekyll & Hyde scenario, where a person has a ""good"" personality, and a ""bad"" one. Switching between these personalities might be signified by visual changes. The ""good"" personality may have trouble controlling the ""bad"" one, which may come out at inopportune times, bully the ""good"" personality into cooperating, or try to take over entirely. If theyre lucky, the character may be able to merge their personalities back together, allowing them to function as a single (and usually greater) mind.

Split Personality|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonality|"A character's mind is split between two or more personalities. Usually, these personalities will have distinct traits, motivations, and memories. They may or may not be able to interact with one another (or even be aware of each other's existence). Control over the character's mind and body will often switch between these personalities against their will, causing problems for both themself and everyone around them.
 Fictional split personalities can be similar to a real-life condition, Dissociative Identity Disorder (or DID). DID is a mental disorder in which more than one distinct personality can be observed at different times within a single individual's brain, often associated with extreme long-term childhood trauma. The individual has no control over when their personalities ""switch"", and may not remember what they did or what happened to them while another personality was active (dissociative amnesia). DID has often been mischaracterized in the media, and its status remains controversial to this day.
 Split personalities have been represented in many different ways over the years. Though characters with such conditions are surprisingly common in fiction, most of them don't match the textbook definitions of DID. The most common case shown is where two (or more) personalities switch with one another; some depictions show people experiencing life as one person (i.e. having the same mind, memory and desires) but with modes of behavior that switch between distinct states.

The most common case shown is where two (or more) personalities switch with one another; some depictions show people experiencing life as one person (i.e. having the same mind, memory and desires) but with modes of behavior that switch between distinct states.
 The most common usage of split personalities is a Jekyll & Hyde scenario, where a person has a ""good"" personality, and a ""bad"" one. Switching between these personalities might be signified by visual changes. The ""good"" personality may have trouble controlling the ""bad"" one, which may come out at inopportune times, bully the ""good"" personality into cooperating, or try to take over entirely. If theyre lucky, the character may be able to merge their personalities back together, allowing them to function as a single (and usually greater) mind.
 Compare and contrast with Double Consciousness, Mind Hive, Sharing a Body, Two Beings, One Body, and Talking to Themself. May overlap with Identity Amnesia. Also compare Many Spirits Inside of One, where a person is possessed by multiple independent spirits; and Napoleon Delusion, where a person falsely believes their body is inhabited by the spirit of a famous figure. When this happens to a superhero, it's often a Superpowered Evil Side. Shapeshifting is sometimes involved. If the personalities go back and forth, Flip Personality ensues.
 If the two personalities are aware of each other, expect a Gollum Made Me Do It situation to develop. Resolving it may require the weaker of the two to say ""I'm Not Afraid of You!""

Split Personality|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonality|"A character's mind is split between two or more personalities. Usually, these personalities will have distinct traits, motivations, and memories. They may or may not be able to interact with one another (or even be aware of each other's existence). Control over the character's mind and body will often switch between these personalities against their will, causing problems for both themself and everyone around them.
 Fictional split personalities can be similar to a real-life condition, Dissociative Identity Disorder (or DID). DID is a mental disorder in which more than one distinct personality can be observed at different times within a single individual's brain, often associated with extreme long-term childhood trauma. The individual has no control over when their personalities ""switch"", and may not remember what they did or what happened to them while another personality was active (dissociative amnesia). DID has often been mischaracterized in the media, and its status remains controversial to this day.

Though characters with such conditions are surprisingly common in fiction, most of them don't match the textbook definitions of DID. The most common case shown is where two (or more) personalities switch with one another; some depictions show people experiencing life as one person (i.e. having the same mind, memory and desires) but with modes of behavior that switch between distinct states.
 The most common usage of split personalities is a Jekyll & Hyde scenario, where a person has a ""good"" personality, and a ""bad"" one. Switching between these personalities might be signified by visual changes. The ""good"" personality may have trouble controlling the ""bad"" one, which may come out at inopportune times, bully the ""good"" personality into cooperating, or try to take over entirely. If theyre lucky, the character may be able to merge their personalities back together, allowing them to function as a single (and usually greater) mind.

Split Personality|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonality|"A character's mind is split between two or more personalities.

DID has often been mischaracterized in the media, and its status remains controversial to this day.
 Split personalities have been represented in many different ways over the years. Though characters with such conditions are surprisingly common in fiction, most of them don't match the textbook definitions of DID. The most common case shown is where two (or more) personalities switch with one another; some depictions show people experiencing life as one person (i.e. having the same mind, memory and desires) but with modes of behavior that switch between distinct states.
 The most common usage of split personalities is a Jekyll & Hyde scenario, where a person has a ""good"" personality, and a ""bad"" one. Switching between these personalities might be signified by visual changes. The ""good"" personality may have trouble controlling the ""bad"" one, which may come out at inopportune times, bully the ""good"" personality into cooperating, or try to take over entirely. If theyre lucky, the character may be able to merge their personalities back together, allowing them to function as a single (and usually greater) mind.

When this happens to a superhero, it's often a Superpowered Evil Side. Shapeshifting is sometimes involved. If the personalities go back and forth, Flip Personality ensues.
 If the two personalities are aware of each other, expect a Gollum Made Me Do It situation to develop. Resolving it may require the weaker of the two to say ""I'm Not Afraid of You!""

The individual has no control over when their personalities ""switch"", and may not remember what they did or what happened to them while another personality was active (dissociative amnesia). DID has often been mischaracterized in the media, and its status remains controversial to this day.
 Split personalities have been represented in many different ways over the years. Though characters with such conditions are surprisingly common in fiction, most of them don't match the textbook definitions of DID. The most common case shown is where two (or more) personalities switch with one another; some depictions show people experiencing life as one person (i.e. having the same mind, memory and desires) but with modes of behavior that switch between distinct states.
 The most common usage of split personalities is a Jekyll & Hyde scenario, where a person has a ""good"" personality, and a ""bad"" one. Switching between these personalities might be signified by visual changes. The ""good"" personality may have trouble controlling the ""bad"" one, which may come out at inopportune times, bully the ""good"" personality into cooperating, or try to take over entirely. If theyre lucky, the character may be able to merge their personalities back together, allowing them to function as a single (and usually greater) mind.

Also compare Many Spirits Inside of One, where a person is possessed by multiple independent spirits; and Napoleon Delusion, where a person falsely believes their body is inhabited by the spirit of a famous figure. When this happens to a superhero, it's often a Superpowered Evil Side. Shapeshifting is sometimes involved. If the personalities go back and forth, Flip Personality ensues.
 If the two personalities are aware of each other, expect a Gollum Made Me Do It situation to develop. Resolving it may require the weaker of the two to say ""I'm Not Afraid of You!"" If the Split Personality gets its own body it becomes either a Literal Split Personality or Enemy Without (if said personality is antagonistic or evil).

DID is a mental disorder in which more than one distinct personality can be observed at different times within a single individual's brain, often associated with extreme long-term childhood trauma. The individual has no control over when their personalities ""switch"", and may not remember what they did or what happened to them while another personality was active (dissociative amnesia). DID has often been mischaracterized in the media, and its status remains controversial to this day.
 Split personalities have been represented in many different ways over the years. Though characters with such conditions are surprisingly common in fiction, most of them don't match the textbook definitions of DID. The most common case shown is where two (or more) personalities switch with one another; some depictions show people experiencing life as one person (i.e. having the same mind, memory and desires) but with modes of behavior that switch between distinct states.
 The most common usage of split personalities is a Jekyll & Hyde scenario, where a person has a ""good"" personality, and a ""bad"" one. Switching between these personalities might be signified by visual changes. The ""good"" personality may have trouble controlling the ""bad"" one, which may come out at inopportune times, bully the ""good"" personality into cooperating, or try to take over entirely. If theyre lucky, the character may be able to merge their personalities back together, allowing them to function as a single (and usually greater) mind.

Split Personality|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonality|"A character's mind is split between two or more personalities. Usually, these personalities will have distinct traits, motivations, and memories. They may or may not be able to interact with one another (or even be aware of each other's existence). Control over the character's mind and body will often switch between these personalities against their will, causing problems for both themself and everyone around them.
 Fictional split personalities can be similar to a real-life condition, Dissociative Identity Disorder (or DID). DID is a mental disorder in which more than one distinct personality can be observed at different times within a single individual's brain, often associated with extreme long-term childhood trauma. The individual has no control over when their personalities ""switch"", and may not remember what they did or what happened to them while another personality was active (dissociative amnesia). DID has often been mischaracterized in the media, and its status remains controversial to this day.
 Split personalities have been represented in many different ways over the years. Though characters with such conditions are surprisingly common in fiction, most of them don't match the textbook definitions of DID. The most common case shown is where two (or more) personalities switch with one another; some depictions show people experiencing life as one person (i.e. having the same mind, memory and desires) but with modes of behavior that switch between distinct states.
 The most common usage of split personalities is a Jekyll & Hyde scenario, where a person has a ""good"" personality, and a ""bad"" one. Switching between these personalities might be signified by visual changes. The ""good"" personality may have trouble controlling the ""bad"" one, which may come out at inopportune times, bully the ""good"" personality into cooperating, or try to take over entirely. If theyre lucky, the character may be able to merge their personalities back together, allowing them to function as a single (and usually greater) mind.

Later on, after the mission to rescue Coo and Amal's father, the remaining female members of Valkyrie Force develop one as well. For the most part they take developing these personalities relatively well, being far more concerned with the prospect of it being early stages of Chimeraization rather than the psychological damages they've suffered, thanks to knowing that it would happen to them in the first place. Bitch in Sheep's Clothing: Ai tends to behave as she normally does before switching into a more abrasive tone and mocking anyone who believes that the normal Ai is anything more than a facade, insisting that she is and always has been the real Ai. The Baroness: Luna treats everyone as being beneath her. They are servants at best, but far more frequently little more than animals there for her own personal amusement. Extreme Doormat: Yue simply can not function without orders, quickly slipping into a locked up panic if someone is not actively ordering her to do anything. Failure to issue orders leads her to start interpreting anything as one, necessitating a ""Wait for further orders"" order just to wait her out. Insufferable Genius: Coo is much like Luna in that everyone is beneath her. Unlike Luna she simply sees everyone as so completely and utterly incompetent and that if she would just be given control of everything things would be so much better. Yandere: Amal becomes violently obsessed with Asahi, which leaves him doing everything he can to avoid setting her off on a murderous rampage. Amal herself is concerned about her other self, Oh, Crap! being her reaction to piecing together Asahi's vague explanation of her behaviors."|Dark Rose Valkyrie|2016|VideoGame

Split Personality|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonality|"A character's mind is split between two or more personalities. Usually, these personalities will have distinct traits, motivations, and memories. They may or may not be able to interact with one another (or even be aware of each other's existence). Control over the character's mind and body will often switch between these personalities against their will, causing problems for both themself and everyone around them.
 Fictional split personalities can be similar to a real-life condition, Dissociative Identity Disorder (or DID). DID is a mental disorder in which more than one distinct personality can be observed at different times within a single individual's brain, often associated with extreme long-term childhood trauma. The individual has no control over when their personalities ""switch"", and may not remember what they did or what happened to them while another personality was active (dissociative amnesia). DID has often been mischaracterized in the media, and its status remains controversial to this day.
 Split personalities have been represented in many different ways over the years. Though characters with such conditions are surprisingly common in fiction, most of them don't match the textbook definitions of DID. The most common case shown is where two (or more) personalities switch with one another; some depictions show people experiencing life as one person (i.e. having the same mind, memory and desires) but with modes of behavior that switch between distinct states.
 The most common usage of split personalities is a Jekyll & Hyde scenario, where a person has a ""good"" personality, and a ""bad"" one. Switching between these personalities might be signified by visual changes. The ""good"" personality may have trouble controlling the ""bad"" one, which may come out at inopportune times, bully the ""good"" personality into cooperating, or try to take over entirely. If theyre lucky, the character may be able to merge their personalities back together, allowing them to function as a single (and usually greater) mind.
 Compare and contrast with Double Consciousness, Mind Hive, Sharing a Body, Two Beings, One Body, and Talking to Themself. May overlap with Identity Amnesia. Also compare Many Spirits Inside of One, where a person is possessed by multiple independent spirits; and Napoleon Delusion, where a person falsely believes their body is inhabited by the spirit of a famous figure. When this happens to a superhero, it's often a Superpowered Evil Side. Shapeshifting is sometimes involved. If the personalities go back and forth, Flip Personality ensues.

With a new intro revealing the two personalities, one that's obsessive and possessive but outwardly friendly and a ""Him"" personality that is more outright threatening (with a much bigger and more sadistic-looking smile to boot). The alpha 2.0 implemented this in gameplay, as various actions the player takes or doesn't take will influence which is in control. In her Yandere State, she fawns over Akira but also concentrates on trapping and preventing him from escaping. Upon discovering the player, she'll remain by their side and remain clingy. Any step the player takes to escape (finding keys, unlocking rooms, etc.) will cause her to knock the player out or to demand they hand over whatever they found; she can even physically choke the player and steal the key from him. Not watching her guarantees she'll jump onto the player's back, and she'll knock them out if the player tries to enter a room. She isn't above helping out if you get too banged up, but the health potions she gives you can sometimes be drugged to make you fall asleep or poisoned. In her Yangire State, she's out for Akira's blood and will take every chance she gets to attack you while also being faster to boot. She'll actively trap doorways with broken glass, vault desks and open windows, and try to stab the player for massive damage if she gets close enough. Occasionally, she'll even throw her knife in order to slow the player so she can strangle them to death. While there is a distinction in behavior between personalities for Akira, however, Yandere Mode seems to show that both are fairly indistinguishable for anyone else, save for her Yandere State laughing a bit less often and being much more serious about ending Shinji's life."|Saiko No Sutoka|2020|VideoGame

Split Personality|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonality|"A character's mind is split between two or more personalities. Usually, these personalities will have distinct traits, motivations, and memories. They may or may not be able to interact with one another (or even be aware of each other's existence). Control over the character's mind and body will often switch between these personalities against their will, causing problems for both themself and everyone around them.
 Fictional split personalities can be similar to a real-life condition, Dissociative Identity Disorder (or DID). DID is a mental disorder in which more than one distinct personality can be observed at different times within a single individual's brain, often associated with extreme long-term childhood trauma. The individual has no control over when their personalities ""switch"", and may not remember what they did or what happened to them while another personality was active (dissociative amnesia). DID has often been mischaracterized in the media, and its status remains controversial to this day.
 Split personalities have been represented in many different ways over the years. Though characters with such conditions are surprisingly common in fiction, most of them don't match the textbook definitions of DID. The most common case shown is where two (or more) personalities switch with one another; some depictions show people experiencing life as one person (i.e. having the same mind, memory and desires) but with modes of behavior that switch between distinct states.
 The most common usage of split personalities is a Jekyll & Hyde scenario, where a person has a ""good"" personality, and a ""bad"" one. Switching between these personalities might be signified by visual changes. The ""good"" personality may have trouble controlling the ""bad"" one, which may come out at inopportune times, bully the ""good"" personality into cooperating, or try to take over entirely. If theyre lucky, the character may be able to merge their personalities back together, allowing them to function as a single (and usually greater) mind.

Split-Personality Makeover|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonalityMakeover|"When dealing with a character that has a Split Personality, there will frequently be a striking visual difference depending on who is ""in control."" It's not a literal transformation, like the original Jekyll and Hyde; it's still recognizably the same person, but the differences will be visible. This may include anything from subtle stylistic changes (the character's design becomes more hard and angular when an evil or aggressive personality is in control, but softer and more rounded when a kind and good personality is in control) to more physical things like changes in hairstyle and black bags under the eyes. A significant vocal shift is common as well.
 Some of these changes are perfectly possible to do without physically altering the person's body, like the personalities having hair that's styled differently (or one of them not styling it at all and another styling it neatly) but the same length, or changes in body language and posture, or talking differently without completely changing voice actors, but others are firmly in the realm of Artistic License.
 These changes may or may not be noticed in-universe; if they are, expect them to treat the change as something intangible. They'll comment ""he's like someone completely different now!"" or ""that's not the person I know!"" rather than ""hey, when did you get your hair cut?"" or ""did your voice just drop two octaves?""."|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bombergirl|Blueberry is Aqua's alternate personality, who has a more modest idol outfit, compared to Aqua's Stripperiffic outfit.

Split-Personality Merge|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonalityMerge|"So Bob is also Charlie, maybe even with a little Albert hiding in there somewhere. There are many possible reasons for the existence of these split personalities, but this co-habitation is rarely peaceful or long lasting, inevitably resulting in a Battle in the Center of the Mind to try and find out which personality will take over. Sometimes though, the winner might not reduce the loser to a tiny, powerless voice or destroy it completely, and instead offers to become one again. With a little Epiphany Therapy, Applied Phlebotinum or even actual psychotherapy, they merge into a single, whole person that is greater than the sum of its minds.
 The resulting merged personality is usually a composite of the parts that is well and truly psychologically stable. This is especially true if they were an id, ego, and super ego. If they were moral or temperamental opposites, the resulting merged personality will keep traits of both. In more action-driven works, this merger includes combat ability and powers, so if the character had a moron and a badass coexisting, the united whole will be a badass all the time... while occasionally tripping on banana peels. Similarly, if the reason for the personality split was to seal awesome cosmic powers away (resulting in a Superpowered Evil Side; see both Enemy Within and Enemy Without) the united self will have full control over these powers without risk of Super-Power Meltdown or corruption. If the integration isn't a completely smooth ride, however, expect aftereffects similar to Amnesiac Dissonance.

Split-Personality Team|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonalityTeam|"Split Personalities aren't always hostile to the original or radically different in Character Alignment. Sometimes the personalities are different in complementary rather than strictly antagonistic ways. Sometimes they even have common goals.
 In a Split Personality Team, a character's multiple personalities have a ""division of labor"" in which each personality takes charge during a particular emotion, challenge, or aspect of life. The personalities that take over during these special circumstances generally have skills or psychological traits that suit them for the job. A common variation is a more resilient or even badass personality that surfaces during moments of extreme stress if the core personality is psychologically fragile.
 The Split-Personality Team is less horror-oriented than other Split Personality Tropes, because the alternates are generally on the core personality's side, or at least looking out for their shared welfare. It's more commonly used in psychologically oriented stories exploring the complexity of a character's fractured mind. Some Real Life accounts of Dissociative Identity Disorder report a similar phenomenon, which may have inspired the trope.

Super-Powered Alter Ego|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredAlterEgo|"The case where a being is able to engage in superheroics or grand villainy not by gaining any powers or by being a Badass Normal, but by being a vessel in some fashion for another personality that does have superpowers, but only when that personality takes control.
 This personality can also look and be physically very different. This takes several superhero/villain issues and solves them in a single stroke. They don't need a disguise because you wouldn't be able to tell by looking at them. Normally, however, writers will not remove the issue of being discovered; they'll use the single moment of transformation as a time where the secret can be discovered or requires the hero diving off into that phone booth. They just don't have to constantly worry about the issue. They can keep the superhero relatable by having the non-powered character be The Everyman or Ordinary High-School Student. They also won't have the same ""using your powers for selfish gain"" issue because a complete personality change can't be used so easily.
 The transformation can often be handled by a Transformation Sequence. Issues about how the personality is split off can vary. Sometimes it's like it's just another person hiding inside their body until the right moment, other times it's a total personality shift but they'll retain the memories of being that Superpowered Alter Ego and it will still be them. Maybe some Fan Wank, or even deliberate ambiguity, will occur over how much the alter ego is a separate personality at all or whether it's more of a Super Mode or Henshin Hero with a confidence boost.

He's wounded and at the end of his strength, and his barely scratched opponent looks down at him and sneers. And then the hero somehow suddenly taps into a massive hidden power source within him and unleashes a can of whoopass on his opponent.
 Unfortunately, it's not exactly the hero anymore. He's got glowing eyes, some new Facial Markings, a different way of talking, some new threads, and a lot less compunction about ripping someone in half. It's his Super-Powered Evil Side. Think of it as the Enemy Within when it's not the enemy, or as Jekyll and super-Hyde.
 Interestingly, notwithstanding the name, this character isn't necessarily evil  he just seems like it because a superpowerful version of a normal person who has no compunctions about randomly destroying things registers objectively as ""evil"" on most people's scale. To be technically accurate, this is more of a Super-Powered Alter Id  this personality is the physical manifestation of the character's basic drives without having to deal with the inconvenience of higher thought processes and morality  but sometimes this character will have traits of actually being evil or even worse.
 Keep in mind, of course, that as the Id not only represents ones most base and primal desires, it also represents the instincts to survive, so once its let out of the subconscious it's not likely to want to go back in. Thus, the hero faces the very real threat of not returning to normal, each bout of Alternate Identity Amnesia causing him to get more worried about the next. Generally speaking, though, he's usually safe unless he starts thinking Evil Feels Good.
 The narrative purpose of having a super-powered evil side is that it provides a way of saving a hero who is otherwise beaten but without making the hero look disproportionately powerful. It answers the question ""why doesn't he just do that all the time?"" with ""because then the evil would take over."" Additionally, if it leads to a FaceHeel Turn, it can serve the same purpose as Good Is Dumb in reverse  it justifies taking one member of the Five-Man Band or whatever and making him a match for his entire team while he has given in to evil. Alternatively, the evil side may escape his mind/body altogether, becoming a very dangerous Evil Counterpart.

Also known as Mazken, Dark Seducers are an intelligent race of lesser Daedra typically found in service to the Daedric Prince Sheogorath. They are more humble and sympathetic toward mortals, having less of a Puny Earthlings attitude toward them than most lesser Daedra. However, they are also known to Fight For The Strongest Side, quickly switching allegiances if it becomes beneficial to them. The group of Dark Seducers fought in Battlespire betrayed their former master (a lieutenant of Nocturnal) to side with Big Bad Mehrunes Dagon when he promised them greater power. They were rewarded by being remade in the image of Dagon's own greed and treachery - becoming not only physically stronger, but also gifted with powerful bat-winged forms.|An Elder Scrolls Legend: Battlespire|1997|VideoGame
Superpowered Evil Side|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide|"The fight's not going so well for our hero. He's wounded and at the end of his strength, and his barely scratched opponent looks down at him and sneers. And then the hero somehow suddenly taps into a massive hidden power source within him and unleashes a can of whoopass on his opponent.
 Unfortunately, it's not exactly the hero anymore. He's got glowing eyes, some new Facial Markings, a different way of talking, some new threads, and a lot less compunction about ripping someone in half. It's his Super-Powered Evil Side. Think of it as the Enemy Within when it's not the enemy, or as Jekyll and super-Hyde.
 Interestingly, notwithstanding the name, this character isn't necessarily evil  he just seems like it because a superpowerful version of a normal person who has no compunctions about randomly destroying things registers objectively as ""evil"" on most people's scale. To be technically accurate, this is more of a Super-Powered Alter Id  this personality is the physical manifestation of the character's basic drives without having to deal with the inconvenience of higher thought processes and morality  but sometimes this character will have traits of actually being evil or even worse.
 Keep in mind, of course, that as the Id not only represents ones most base and primal desires, it also represents the instincts to survive, so once its let out of the subconscious it's not likely to want to go back in. Thus, the hero faces the very real threat of not returning to normal, each bout of Alternate Identity Amnesia causing him to get more worried about the next. Generally speaking, though, he's usually safe unless he starts thinking Evil Feels Good.
 The narrative purpose of having a super-powered evil side is that it provides a way of saving a hero who is otherwise beaten but without making the hero look disproportionately powerful. It answers the question ""why doesn't he just do that all the time?"" with ""because then the evil would take over."" Additionally, if it leads to a FaceHeel Turn, it can serve the same purpose as Good Is Dumb in reverse  it justifies taking one member of the Five-Man Band or whatever and making him a match for his entire team while he has given in to evil. Alternatively, the evil side may escape his mind/body altogether, becoming a very dangerous Evil Counterpart.
 This is the converse of With Great Power Comes Great Insanity, seeing as in this case, with great insanity comes great power.
 One possible variation on this trope makes the Evil Side the original personality. This creates the odd situation of an ""Evil"" super-powerful monster whose ""Good"" not-as-powerful personality is dominant for whatever reason.

Superpowered Evil Side|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide|"The fight's not going so well for our hero. He's wounded and at the end of his strength, and his barely scratched opponent looks down at him and sneers. And then the hero somehow suddenly taps into a massive hidden power source within him and unleashes a can of whoopass on his opponent.
 Unfortunately, it's not exactly the hero anymore. He's got glowing eyes, some new Facial Markings, a different way of talking, some new threads, and a lot less compunction about ripping someone in half. It's his Super-Powered Evil Side. Think of it as the Enemy Within when it's not the enemy, or as Jekyll and super-Hyde.
 Interestingly, notwithstanding the name, this character isn't necessarily evil  he just seems like it because a superpowerful version of a normal person who has no compunctions about randomly destroying things registers objectively as ""evil"" on most people's scale. To be technically accurate, this is more of a Super-Powered Alter Id  this personality is the physical manifestation of the character's basic drives without having to deal with the inconvenience of higher thought processes and morality  but sometimes this character will have traits of actually being evil or even worse.
 Keep in mind, of course, that as the Id not only represents ones most base and primal desires, it also represents the instincts to survive, so once its let out of the subconscious it's not likely to want to go back in. Thus, the hero faces the very real threat of not returning to normal, each bout of Alternate Identity Amnesia causing him to get more worried about the next. Generally speaking, though, he's usually safe unless he starts thinking Evil Feels Good.
 The narrative purpose of having a super-powered evil side is that it provides a way of saving a hero who is otherwise beaten but without making the hero look disproportionately powerful. It answers the question ""why doesn't he just do that all the time?"" with ""because then the evil would take over."" Additionally, if it leads to a FaceHeel Turn, it can serve the same purpose as Good Is Dumb in reverse  it justifies taking one member of the Five-Man Band or whatever and making him a match for his entire team while he has given in to evil. Alternatively, the evil side may escape his mind/body altogether, becoming a very dangerous Evil Counterpart.
 This is the converse of With Great Power Comes Great Insanity, seeing as in this case, with great insanity comes great power.

He's wounded and at the end of his strength, and his barely scratched opponent looks down at him and sneers. And then the hero somehow suddenly taps into a massive hidden power source within him and unleashes a can of whoopass on his opponent.
 Unfortunately, it's not exactly the hero anymore. He's got glowing eyes, some new Facial Markings, a different way of talking, some new threads, and a lot less compunction about ripping someone in half. It's his Super-Powered Evil Side. Think of it as the Enemy Within when it's not the enemy, or as Jekyll and super-Hyde.
 Interestingly, notwithstanding the name, this character isn't necessarily evil  he just seems like it because a superpowerful version of a normal person who has no compunctions about randomly destroying things registers objectively as ""evil"" on most people's scale. To be technically accurate, this is more of a Super-Powered Alter Id  this personality is the physical manifestation of the character's basic drives without having to deal with the inconvenience of higher thought processes and morality  but sometimes this character will have traits of actually being evil or even worse.
 Keep in mind, of course, that as the Id not only represents ones most base and primal desires, it also represents the instincts to survive, so once its let out of the subconscious it's not likely to want to go back in. Thus, the hero faces the very real threat of not returning to normal, each bout of Alternate Identity Amnesia causing him to get more worried about the next. Generally speaking, though, he's usually safe unless he starts thinking Evil Feels Good.
 The narrative purpose of having a super-powered evil side is that it provides a way of saving a hero who is otherwise beaten but without making the hero look disproportionately powerful. It answers the question ""why doesn't he just do that all the time?"" with ""because then the evil would take over."" Additionally, if it leads to a FaceHeel Turn, it can serve the same purpose as Good Is Dumb in reverse  it justifies taking one member of the Five-Man Band or whatever and making him a match for his entire team while he has given in to evil. Alternatively, the evil side may escape his mind/body altogether, becoming a very dangerous Evil Counterpart.

He's wounded and at the end of his strength, and his barely scratched opponent looks down at him and sneers. And then the hero somehow suddenly taps into a massive hidden power source within him and unleashes a can of whoopass on his opponent.
 Unfortunately, it's not exactly the hero anymore. He's got glowing eyes, some new Facial Markings, a different way of talking, some new threads, and a lot less compunction about ripping someone in half. It's his Super-Powered Evil Side. Think of it as the Enemy Within when it's not the enemy, or as Jekyll and super-Hyde.
 Interestingly, notwithstanding the name, this character isn't necessarily evil  he just seems like it because a superpowerful version of a normal person who has no compunctions about randomly destroying things registers objectively as ""evil"" on most people's scale. To be technically accurate, this is more of a Super-Powered Alter Id  this personality is the physical manifestation of the character's basic drives without having to deal with the inconvenience of higher thought processes and morality  but sometimes this character will have traits of actually being evil or even worse.
 Keep in mind, of course, that as the Id not only represents ones most base and primal desires, it also represents the instincts to survive, so once its let out of the subconscious it's not likely to want to go back in. Thus, the hero faces the very real threat of not returning to normal, each bout of Alternate Identity Amnesia causing him to get more worried about the next. Generally speaking, though, he's usually safe unless he starts thinking Evil Feels Good.
 The narrative purpose of having a super-powered evil side is that it provides a way of saving a hero who is otherwise beaten but without making the hero look disproportionately powerful. It answers the question ""why doesn't he just do that all the time?"" with ""because then the evil would take over."" Additionally, if it leads to a FaceHeel Turn, it can serve the same purpose as Good Is Dumb in reverse  it justifies taking one member of the Five-Man Band or whatever and making him a match for his entire team while he has given in to evil. Alternatively, the evil side may escape his mind/body altogether, becoming a very dangerous Evil Counterpart.

Superpowered Evil Side|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide|"The fight's not going so well for our hero. He's wounded and at the end of his strength, and his barely scratched opponent looks down at him and sneers. And then the hero somehow suddenly taps into a massive hidden power source within him and unleashes a can of whoopass on his opponent.
 Unfortunately, it's not exactly the hero anymore. He's got glowing eyes, some new Facial Markings, a different way of talking, some new threads, and a lot less compunction about ripping someone in half. It's his Super-Powered Evil Side. Think of it as the Enemy Within when it's not the enemy, or as Jekyll and super-Hyde.
 Interestingly, notwithstanding the name, this character isn't necessarily evil  he just seems like it because a superpowerful version of a normal person who has no compunctions about randomly destroying things registers objectively as ""evil"" on most people's scale. To be technically accurate, this is more of a Super-Powered Alter Id  this personality is the physical manifestation of the character's basic drives without having to deal with the inconvenience of higher thought processes and morality  but sometimes this character will have traits of actually being evil or even worse.
 Keep in mind, of course, that as the Id not only represents ones most base and primal desires, it also represents the instincts to survive, so once its let out of the subconscious it's not likely to want to go back in. Thus, the hero faces the very real threat of not returning to normal, each bout of Alternate Identity Amnesia causing him to get more worried about the next. Generally speaking, though, he's usually safe unless he starts thinking Evil Feels Good.
 The narrative purpose of having a super-powered evil side is that it provides a way of saving a hero who is otherwise beaten but without making the hero look disproportionately powerful. It answers the question ""why doesn't he just do that all the time?"" with ""because then the evil would take over."" Additionally, if it leads to a FaceHeel Turn, it can serve the same purpose as Good Is Dumb in reverse  it justifies taking one member of the Five-Man Band or whatever and making him a match for his entire team while he has given in to evil. Alternatively, the evil side may escape his mind/body altogether, becoming a very dangerous Evil Counterpart.
 This is the converse of With Great Power Comes Great Insanity, seeing as in this case, with great insanity comes great power.
 One possible variation on this trope makes the Evil Side the original personality. This creates the odd situation of an ""Evil"" super-powerful monster whose ""Good"" not-as-powerful personality is dominant for whatever reason.
 This is sometimes the reason to Beware the Nice Ones. Compare with Crouching Moron, Hidden Badass, Demonic Possession, Jekyll & Hyde and One-Winged Angel.

Twin Test|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwinTest|"The twin test is a quiz in which identical siblings ask other characters to point out which sibling is which. This can be done in a variety of ways, most commonly with the twins asking someone to identify them either face-to-face or using photos.
 The twin test is often Played for Laughs, especially with Trickster Twins. If someone is particularly good at the test, the siblings may become obsessed with stumping them, escalating the difficulty of the test to absurd levels by dressing the same, adopting similar mannerisms, or even pretending to be the other twin. Single-Minded Twins giving a twin test are typically played for laughs with the joke being that the obvious lack of distinct personalities between the two will make answering correctly a matter of chance. The justifications a character gives for their answer, regardless of whether they were right or wrong, are ripe with comedic potential.
 When Played for Drama, if most people fail the test, at least one of the siblings may become withdrawn or jaded about the nature of their own individuality. It may also jump-start a desire for one sibling to differentiate themselves as much as possible from the other and distancing themself from their sibling(s) in the process. Expect someone who consistently passes to be considered a True Companion or One True Love, since only someone who really gets the siblings can pass the test.
 If siblings have Identical Twin ID Tag or experienced Twin Desynch, they are far less likely to give a twin test since the answer would be obvious (though savvy twins can exploit this). In more fantastical or action-oriented stories that include an Evil Twin, a twin test may be used to confuse or thwart The Hero and is likely to include raising the stakes of answering incorrectly into a Matter of Life and Death.
 This trope also applies to Split Personality Tropes if one (or multiple) personalities asks a character if they can tell when a given personality is in control. Since typically no two personalities can be present at the same time (unless you're dealing with Literal Split Personalities), this is likely to happen over the long run, spanning multiple smaller tests.
 Compare and contrast Spot the Imposter and Impostor-Exposing Test, which similarly focuses on a character correctly identifying another from a doppleganger. What separates this trope from those is that while the twin test can include one sibling pretending to be another, this is not fundamental and typically the twins present genuine representations of themselves. Similarly, in the case of split personalities, a twin test may involve Hyde Plays Jekyll, but it is not necessary for the trope.
 See also Twin Switch and Identical Twin Mistake. Making Use of the Twin can sometimes serve as a Real Life version of this trope for viewers."|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LoveAndPies|When Joe arrives to see his identical twin brother Sam impersonating him to date Amelia, Sam claims that he's the real Joe while Sam was out at the baker's retreat.
