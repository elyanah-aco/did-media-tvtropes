Handicapped Badass|For a certain value of handicapped. Jake Preston is discovered to suffer from an eye dominance problem, which makes it very difficult for him to use the Apache's monocle-based targeting system, since he's left-eyed dominant and the monocle is mounted on the right side of the helmet. Little helps him overcome this by strapping a pair of panties onto Jake's head. Little's wife mentions that Little himself had the same problem at one point.|Fire Birds|1990|Film|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FireBirds
An Arm and a Leg|The hero loses one of his arms in a trap while attempting to get one of the Seven Pillars, and has to get it replaced with a robotic arm that also serves as the COMP upgrade of the game. The missing arm is even reflected in game as a status ailment that deals continuous damage to the hero and prevents the player from using the COMP.|Megami Tensei II|1990|VideoGame|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegamiTenseiII

Eyepatch of Power|Worn by One-Eyed Jack.|Mad Dog Mccree|1990|VideoGame|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MadDogMccree
Eyepatch of Power|Subverted slightly in that Big Boss' eyepatch really is an eyepatch, while Old Snake's Solid Eye simply provides optical enhancements... as well as 'radar,' of sorts. Well, then there's also Solidus. Raiden Custom Body's eyepatch acts as a cybernetic eye, since Doktor couldn't get a replacement after he lost his eye to Sam (in fact, the eyepatch he uses has all the benefits of a fully operational artificial compound eye, and all the coolness of an eyepatch).|Metal Gear|1990|VideoGame|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear
Handicapped Badass|Silver lost his left leg to a broadside a long time ago, but still manages to kill a man much younger than him in a fight.

Eunuchs Are Evil|Near the ending of Quest For Glory II, the Thief hero must sneak past several eunuchs to get into the palace at Raseir* The mage can use magic to avoid them entirely, while the Fighter just beats up everyone in his way. - they are more Punch Clock Villains than evil and probably had their jobs when the emir was still in power, still, if they see you it's game over.|Quest for Glory II|1990|VideoGame|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuestForGloryII
Obfuscating Disability|"After Angelo is severely beaten, he pretends to be so brain-damaged that the only word he can utter is ""Florida.""

Attention Deficit... Ooh, Shiny!|The world beyond the castle is so foreign to Edward that he's fascinated by virtually everything he sees, and often gets distracted just as people are showing him around/leading him on. In particular, he seems intrigued by things he can use as material for his unconventional art (hedges, dogs, etc.) or remind him of his old life (in the salon, he notes a chair with a dryer mounted atop it, which vaguely resembles some of the castle machinery). Even when he participates in the robbery, Jim has to pull him away from the hedges by the front door!|Edward Scissorhands|1990|Film|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EdwardScissorhands

An Arm and a Leg|Lt. Boles lost a leg, presumably during the war. This has nothing to do with the story other than to make it a little bit weirder, as it just so happens that the family he's billeted with has a spare artificial leg lying around.|Archangel|1990|Film|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Archangel

Perdita, a henchwoman of Santos who has a personal story with Sailor, but nonetheless lies to him, in spite of the deal they had to warn each other if they knew that someone ever called out a hit on them and participates in assassinating Johnnie Farragut, can still walk, but she is shown to have a strange way of carrying her body and occasionally is seen using leg braces and crutches, implying that she suffered some serious physical damage at some point.|Wild at Heart|1990|Film|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WildAtHeart

Symbolic Mutilation|"Big Boss's trademark is an Eyepatch of Power, which we see him receive in Metal Gear Solid 3 (when he attacks Ocelot to keep him from assassinating Tatyana and ends up getting his right eye blinded by muzzle flare in a freak accident). His loss of the eye doesn't happen at exactly the same time as the large traumatic event that sculpts his character (the death of The Boss), but does serve to distinguish the difference from a rather innocent and ordinary soldier to a single-minded, ambitious and traumatised one. This injury is then repeated with over the course of the series symbolising the difference in each character's outlook compared to Big Boss: In Metal Gear Solid 2, Raiden accidentally injures Solidus's left eye, which he appears almost ecstatic about, in accordance with his general fixation on Big Boss. He immediately starts wearing an eyepatch on it and even suggests being grateful to Raiden for doing it to him. Of course, his injuries are actually a mirror-image of Big Boss's, signifying that he himself is just a reflection of Big Boss rather than an individual in his own right. In Metal Gear Solid 4, Solid Snake begins wearing an electronic sensor over his eye that resembles Big Boss's eyepatch. Between that, his visible ageing and the fact that his muscle-suit resembles Big Boss's bulky build rather than his own more sinewy one, he resembles Big Boss a lot - more to screw with the audience than anything (going from a Big Boss who looked like Solid Snake in 3 to a Solid Snake who looked like Big Boss in 4). While saving Big Mama (the same person as Tatyana, just many years on) from a fire, the sensor explodes and damages Snake's face, with the result of inverting Big Boss's injury - a burned face but a functioning eye. This serves to indicate Solid Snake's defiance of his own fate - his face, the thing that ties him to Big Boss, has been mutilated; and his ties to Big Boss - he got the injuries rescuing the same person; but most importantly his ability to still ""see"" things Big Boss has become ""blinded"" to. Raiden also has a missing eye in Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance. This is because his eye and his arm were mangled by Sam at the beginning of the game - throughout the game, Raiden gets bonuses for chopping off enemies' right arms, repeating the injury done on him. The eye injury is covered, instead of with an eyepatch, with a bandanna resembling the one worn by Solid Snake, signifying to whom his allegiance is. Metal Gear Ac!d 2 significantly uses a copy of The Boss's caesarian scar on the back of the female character Lucy - particularly unusual as the Ac!d games happen in an entirely separate universe to the main games. However, it supports Lucy's character as being a horrible monstrosity of a matriarch, child and wife figure simultaneously (referencing the description of The Boss from Metal Gear Solid 3 - ""she was like a mother to me, and my master."" ""And your lover?""). As well as, more directly, suggesting some of the horrible surgical mutilations she would have received from the Mad Scientist responsible for creating her.

Prosthetic Limb Reveal|At the end of Metal Gear Solid 2, Ocelot had been taken over by the transplanted arm of Liquid Snake the last we saw him. In Metal Gear Solid 4, their personalities had (supposedly) merged. Come the climax of that game, Ocelot throws off his coat, to reveal said arm is now robotic. This hints that the merged persona was an act all along.|Metal Gear|1990|VideoGame|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear
"""L"" Is for ""Dyslexia"""|Played straight with a dyslexia disorder that manifests as read text displayed to the player having characters rearranged and rotated (though the implementation doesn't go so far as Spoonerisms).|Lost Souls (MUD)|1990|VideoGame|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LostSoulsMUD

Prosthetic Limb Reveal|Benny seems like a perfectly normal taxi driver, until he helps Quaid/Hauser get into the resistance base by taking off his prosthetic hand, opening his sleeve and showing his mutated lower arm, revealing himself to be a mutant.

How it happened, we'll never know.|The Secret of Monkey Island|1990|VideoGame|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSecretOfMonkeyIsland
Abled in the Adaptation|In real life, Henry Hill had learning disabilities so severe that he didn't learn the alphabet until he was twenty. The movie doesn't really touch on this fact, aside from him having a difficult time in school, and even then a viewer could easily get the impression that he did poorly simply because he was already uninterested in an honest living.|Goodfellas|1990|Film|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Goodfellas
Prophet Eyes|The aliens have white eyes.|I Come in Peace|1990|Film|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IComeInPeace

Crippling Overspecialization|Submarines are very powerful against other ships, but without giving them one-use missiles, they can't attack land targets. Averted in VI—submarines (and their advanced Nuclear Sub counterparts) are now quite capable of bombarding cities and land-units, and even destroying Improvements... in fact, due to their special ability (being invisible to anything more than one hex away), they're GREAT for it, since they can easily avoid counterattacks by keeping out to sea.|Civilization|1991|VideoGame|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization
Attention Deficit... Ooh, Shiny!|"In the middle of the Celts' raid on the Merry Men's camp, Robin starts dumping chests full of gold coins on the bloodthirsty marauders. They stop right in their tracks to pick up said booty, every last one of them, seeming to completely forget about the raging battle surrounding them that they initiated. Of course, they are explicitly identified as ""hired thugs"". When he is Storming the Castle, Robin pauses to do a Double Take at the Sheriff's statue, which previously was defaced to include the scar Robin gave him. As noted below, it's almost more of a Chekhov's Gun.

Hollywood Tourette's|Faked by Bob. He randomly shouts profanity (and gets Siggy to start doing the same to distract him from his fear of death), reasoning that if he pretends to have Tourette's, then he doesn't have to worry about really having it.

Crippling Overspecialization|A number of monsters have a nasty response prepared when hit with weapons. Since the Knight never uses anything but swords, this leaves them wide open to counter-attacks in some places, the worst example being the Great Sea Trench. The reliance on swordplay makes them susceptible to enemies that can buff their own Defense. Monk is a World 1 job because they never actually increase in worth. Their inability to use weapons largely cancels out their damage. Thieves aren't the best combatants. Unlike the Bard (who can Hide) and White Mage (who has Shell status and plenty of healing magic), the Thief simply has to tank damage and guzzle stolen Potions. This is probably the job where Strength matters the most, since they have no way to boost damage, and the base stat is so very low for a melee-based job. Returning players won't need to use Find Passages since they know where all the hidden rooms are. No job in the game is as static as the Berserker. They can't even use the Earth Hammer and Rune Axe effectively due to their atrocious Magic. They lose to everything due to being unable to do stuff like Summon...heck, Berserkers can't even use Item. They are particularly screwed by back attacks, as they'll be stuck in the back row and unable to change their position. Dragoons don't benefit from equipment skills, since Jump only boosts spear damage and they already have armor and shield proficiency. Spears are incompatible with Two-Handed and Spellblade. On top of that, Dragoons don't mesh well with Cover and Counter, since they spend half the battle not being there. The Dancer is stuck in a weird hybrid role; not quite a melee-focused job, but not quite a spellcaster either. Sword Dance does tremendous damage...when it lands. Sword Dance doesn't happen often enough to give to melee characters. Since Lamia's Tiara is a hat which only Magi can equip, you can't boost your odds on other jobs.|Final Fantasy V|1992|VideoGame|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV

Lighting Jack has trouble with things that are up close, needing reading glasses, and finds it funny to find out that he knocked a bank off for fifty dollars, but he can hit anything another person points at, and the target would be dead before the other's finger straightens. Ben is a mute, but this doesn't stop him from busting Lightning Jack out of jail, nor from setting up a rival group of outlaws to be captured by the townsfolk — sometimes the written word works. An outlaw by the name of ""Bad Eyes"" McBain is mentioned by Lightning Jack as a fella who really needed glasses. He got around this issue by using a special Sawed-Off Shotgun, which Ben got from Lightning Jack.

Crippling Overspecialization|Each noble has their strengths and weaknesses, which you can often exploit: The Knight likes to create lots of armies and send them into battles frequently, but his domestic skill is very poor, with bad economy and over-reliance on wooden palisade castles. On higher difficulties, it's possible for him to be permanently stuck on one county as his rapidly-built armies are unable to conquer any neutral towns. The Bishop fields large armies and prefers to build as many top-tier royal castles as possible. But he has a tendency to overexpand, and his armies have a huge ratio of peasants that will be easily cut down by real soldiers. Though assaulting his castles can be a hassle, taking out his armies and counties that don't have a built castle can be easy if you can get to it before the castle is built. The Baron is a cautious and defensive economist. He takes time building up his counties, so if you can take him out early, he's a pushover. But if you let him build up his counties and armies, he can be quite a threat. The Countess is a mix of the other lords, averaging out to an aggressive expansionist with a good economy. She can sometimes overexpand much like the Bishop, but she relies heavily on the weaker Motte and Bailey castle, making her lands vulnerable to being cut in half. Her armies often contain a mix of troops, including crossbows, making her more dangerous than the other nobles if left alone for too long.|Lords of the Realm|1994|VideoGame|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LordsOfTheRealm2

Crippling Overspecialization|Subverted by the Epyon. It's the only mobile suit without any long range weapons whatsoever, not even the head/shoulder mounted machine guns to shoot down incoming missiles, which is standard issue even on mook units (it is later added to Epyon's head, but even then it was only used once in the entire series). But its ZERO System more than compensates for any deficiency; combined with its superior melee power, Epyon is one of the, if not the most powerful mobile suit in the series, tied with Wing Zero. Where Wing Zero gets the BFG, Epyon gets the BFS.|Mobile Suit Gundam Wing|1995|Anime|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing

Crippling Overspecialization|The Allied cruiser deals heavy damage and can hit targets at extremely long ranges. But on the other hand, it's expensive, moves very slowly, and is completely defenseless against air units and submarines. A cruiser that is not protected by gunboats and destroyers is unlikely to survive very long. Attack dogs can One-Hit Kill infantry, sniff out spies and... well, that's it. Infantry becomes more or less useless once tanks show up and the AI never uses spies, making dogs obsolete past the earliest game stages. Their only real purpose seems to be to annoy the player in infantry-only campaign missions where they show up as enemies.

Crippling Overspecialization|Snipers are pretty much designed to shoot enemy drivers/gunners and capture their vehicle/gun. They will lose against any infantry except Grunts, and even that's a waste because Grunts are much quicker to build. Also, sending them unsupported against powerful vehicles will not work, as said vehicle will just demolish them before they get the chance to shoot it. Jeeps are fast and quick to produce. Their role is to capture territories quickly and draw fire from more valuable units. When it comes to actual fighting, though, they're very weak, as they will generally lose to just about every other unit except Grunts. Grunts are not much different from Jeeps, and their only real strength is that they're quick to produce and can wade through water, making them great for quickly capturing territory and equipment but nothing else. They are practically useless in combat against anything except other Grunts. Gatlings are only good for defending against early rushes by Grunts, Psychos or Jeeps, and are pretty much useless otherwise because they are fragile, ineffective against armour, and many units out-range them. Cranes can only repair bridges and maybe serve as a distraction. They move slowly and have no weapon at all.|Z|1996|VideoGame|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Z
Crippling Overspecialization|Aside from his long drive, Happy's golf skills aren't much to talk about. His putting in particular is quite poor, but he ultimately defies this trope by accepting Chubbs' training offer and learning on a miniature golf course. It's also the major thing holding Happy's hockey career back. He has a killer slapshot at the cost of being mediocre at every other aspect of the game, as he focuses entirely on becoming tougher without bothering to become a decent skater or defender.

Crippling Overspecialization|Parasect (and its pre-evolution Paras) is the only Pokémon in the game with Spore, the only 100% accurate Sleep-inducing move (other Sleep-inducing moves have no better than 75% accuracy). Unfortunately, Parasect has awful stats, including being tied with Snorlax and Slowbro for the slowest fully-evolved Pokémon in the game, but without anywhere near the durability they have to afford taking hits. Parasect also learns few other worthwhile moves — the only Bug-type move it learns is the pitiful 20 power Leech Life, and it doesn't learn the only good Grass-type attack Razor Leaf, preventing it from making real use of its STAB and any possible type advantages. Plus, while its dual Grass/Bug typing gives it a valuable double resistance to Ground moves and a resistance to Water moves, it comes with a slew of exploitable weaknesses, including a crippling double weakness to Fire- and Flying-types. So all Parasect can really do is put an opposing Pokémon to sleep with certainty... if it can get a move in at all, that is. Onix has an insane Defense stat (at 160, it's the second-highest in the game after Cloyster's 180), but other than that, its only other remotely decent stat is a below-average Speed of 70. Its other stats are awful, with an anemic 45 Attack, very low health of 35, and barely-existent Special of 30. So Onix isn't doing much damage, and Special hits will destroy it, with even resisted ones still doing a lot of damage. On top of that, being a Rock/Ground-type gives it a plethora of weaknesses, including double weaknesses to Water and Grass moves, which with its low Special means it'll get one-shotted by Water and Grass moves unless it's ludicrously over-levelled (and still maybe not even then). Electric moves can't hurt it and Onix can tank Normal and Flying moves all day, but if the opponent has anything else, then Onix isn't doing much of anything. Electrode is the fastest Pokémon in this generation, with a base Speed stat of 140 while nothing else is faster than 130, and since this is in the days before held items, limited EV distribution, and natures, Electrode will always go first on equal grounds against any Pokémon but another Electrode. Plus, as Gen 1 based critical hits off of raw Speed, this also means Electrode has the highest critical hit rate, with it critting 27.45% of the time. However, Speed is all Electrode has; its Special is a mediocre 80, it is very frail with HP and Defense stats of 60 and 70 respectively, and it has an anemic Attack of 50. Electrode falls quickly to both Physical and Special attacks, it doesn't hit hard in return, and its movepool consists of just Electric and Normal moves, the latter of which, with its awful Attack, will be barely hurting opponents. Plus, with Speed being its only advantage, a paralyzed Electrode is practically useless. Jolteon pretty much just outclasses it; it trades a mere 10 Speed (allowing it to still outspeed or speed-tie everything but Electrode) in exchange for much better Special, less pathetic Attack, and access to Double Kick and Pin Missile to deal greater damage to Rock/Ground and Grass Pokémon that are immune to or resist Electric moves. Electrode's only real use is being the fastest Pokémon with Explosion (which coming off its 50 Attack still isn't going to hurt that much), and if you're fighting someone's Mewtwo, it's the only thing that will for sure be able to outspeed and paralyze Mewtwo to give the rest of your team a shot against him.

Crippling Overspecialization|Most types of Holy Blood give a person a 20% growth increase in HP and a 30% growth increase in exactly one other stat. Coupled with the generally low growth rates for first generation characters in this game this generally means that most units with Holy Blood tend to be very strong in that particular stat and decidedly subpar everywhere else. Chulainn for example has extremely high HP (110%) and skill (80%) growth rates, but is rather mediocre in everything else, a trait he tends to pass onto his children if he has any. Ditto Lachesis, whose children with their Hoðr Blood usually have a strength growth in the range of 70-80%, but rather lowish growth rates in skill, speed and defense, and single-digit growth rates in magic.|Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War|1996|VideoGame|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemGenealogyOfTheHolyWar

Artificial Limbs|Rasczak's mechanical left hand. In his first scene he just has a stump, so it seems that he got it fixed when he signed back up with the Mobile Infantry. The recruitment officer also has one.

Crippling Overspecialization|"Played for Laughs in Spirits. Kilobots have no non-violent abilities or programming, so if you need to do something like, say, halt a speeding truck to keep yourself from falling out of the back, your kilobot will be unable to help you — ""stop the truck"" isn't an attack. Seems to become subverted after this incident as the Kilobots begin getting smart enough to at least speak whole sentences, most likely because Kam wouldn't be able to sell them if they seemed too dangerous."|Medabots|1997|VideoGame|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Medabots

Crippling Overspecialization|The Hybrids. They have great psychic powers and slightly greater reflexes than human soldiers, but are inferior in all other ways. Even worse, they improve their physical stats slowly, and you must assign them to a gym if you want to train their low strength — i.e. they will either be unable to carry much, or they won't be able to train their Psionic powers in the Psi-gym. Finally, they need a special device to use their powers, which means one of their hands will always be full — i.e. they're usually restricted to using pistols, or suffering accuracy penalties. All that said, they have the potential to become X-Com's most powerful agents; it's just that getting there requires literally months of in-game time as well as careful planning and supervision on the player's part.|X-COM: Apocalypse|1997|VideoGame|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XComApocalypse

It holds a huge amount of ammo and, when close to an enemy, can burn through them quickly and effectively - if a threat is at any distance further than near-point-blank, however, it has to rely on its limited supply of other special weapons to deal with it.

Crippling Overspecialization|The worst hit are generally heavy tanks and bombers. Most heavy tanks are so slow to maneuver that a single well-controlled helicopter can dismantle an entire formation. Bombers are specialized for attacking tanks and structures under AI controls but aren't particularly effective against anything else that are positioned higher than them. But this is usually averted in many cases, such as when the AI destroys your aircraft with bombers by flying above them, or player-controlled heavy tanks able to tackle on most targets with their powerful long-range shells. From a faction-perspective, the Sulgogars somewhat fulfills this too, but their weakness is not so much physical but rather in terms of overall capability. The Sulgogars has one of the strongest attacks in the game, eclipsing even the Mykonians in many cases. However, they are heavily crippled by their lack of versatility: They cannot create their own power source, they only have a total of 3 different attacking units with their 2 heavy hitters (Slime Lord, Mean Green) easily defeated by anti-air tanks. The only other attacking Sulgogarian unit is the Blue Spore, whose anti-tank capabilities mitigate that glaring weakness to some extent. However, given its low flight altitude under AI-control, the Blue Spore is in turn mostly useless against air units - Even with the powerful machine gun particle as its support, the Blue Spore barely scratches the moderately high flying units. With the right tactics and units the Sulgogars are not too difficult to kill, in fact a seasoned player might arguably find them the easiest faction to beat. The Resistance Rhino is a good example. It is pretty useless outside of destroying enemy host stations or power/flak/radar stations - Which still requires the player to take direct control of to use effectively. The Resistance Rock Sled is only usable if the player takes direct control of. Its sole purpose is that of a suicide bomber, capable of a sector-wide destructive wave. The Taerkasten Zeppelin in practice is mostly useful as a pre-deployed scout or a strong defence unit holding a bottleneck terrain and not so much an attacker even though it is the toughest vehicle (Other than host stations) to destroy and has the strongest bomber attack in the game.|Urban Assault|1998|VideoGame|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UrbanAssault

Crippling Overspecialization|Some of the units in the game are specialized for a specific role a bit too much for their own good, especially when customized with additional weapons. Rocket tanks are capable of unleashing withering long-range fire with near-unavoidable homing rockets, a veritable Macross Missile Massacre when equipped with a TAG Cannon, or even mortar fire if customized, but pay for it by all of their weapon options being inefficient with the ammo. They can very rapidly kill mobile units, but often fail to kill a hardened target like a Recycler before running out unless the player expends resources to upgrade them with mortars... which renders the AI unable to use the missiles anymore. Bombers with their dual Rocket Bombs are capable of delivering a Curbstomp Battle to practically anything they get their sights on... but turning around is something they are really not good at. If they fail to kill the target quickly with their overwhelming firepower and said target ends up anywhere other than in front of the bomber, that situation will turn into a Curbstomp Battle in the other direction real fast. They also suffer from having no weaker weapons for targets against whom Rocket Bombs would be overkill unless upgraded with one.

Crippling Overspecialization|"A few planes suffer from this: The F-117 is an egregious example. It can only carry two GBU-27 laser guided bunker busters for precision surgical strikes, it handles like a lumbering turkey and is therefore not something you take to a dogfight or enemy air defense suppression, as it won't do well against missiles. It is very stealthy and can slip past most of these defenses, but only at night. A nighttime surgical strike on a well fortified target is the only mission this plane can pull off. The A-10 Thunderbolt ""Warthog"" is another plane built for one specific mission. It is a slow lumbering sluggish to handle craft, that is designed for one purpose - killing enemy tanks. It has lots of hard points to store bombs or air to ground missiles, but only a token set of short range Sidewinders for dogfighting. Not that you should attempt to take on fighters with this, as it handles like a pig. It isn't useful for Wild Weasel anti air defense suppression missions either, due to its inability to dodge missiles. It can however, loiter at low altitude and pick off tanks till it runs out of ammo. The F-22 is a dogfighter and nothing more. It mostly carries six air to air missiles, and therefore should not be used for ground attacks, or SEAD missions. (It can carry JDAM bombs, but almost none of the missions lend it the opportunity to use them.)"|Janes USAF|1999|VideoGame|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JanesUSAF

Crippling Overspecialization|Dictated by damage modifiers of the weapon in question. Double points goes to weapons which haven't received upgrades yet. Antitanks, for instance, excel only against vehicles and (before the late game upgrades) fails miserably at everything else. Weapons can also be severely limited to attacking aircraft or ground targets only. But the eponymous Bunker Buster tops the rest by being the only antistructure weapon, meaning that unless you are clearing bunkers, there is little point to use the Bunker Buster besides spare firepower.|Warzone 2100|1999|VideoGame|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warzone2100

Crippling Overspecialization|Once a 4-legged AFW is in short range, it may as well present its exhaust pipe. Accuracy drops to single digits (as low as three!). At long range, it's king, at medium, it can still send heavy payloads hurtling downrange, and at short, it's cannon fodder. It's actually more effective to walk up to the enemy and let them hit you once with their Power Fist to end the battle sooner than risk taking a handful of cannon shots while you futilely spit potshots (especially if you brought someone with land mines).|Ring of Red|2000|VideoGame|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RingOfRed

Crippling Overspecialization|Can happen if you stick with one god through all 9 levels. Persephone is probably the biggest offender, since she has creatures that heal fast by themselves AND a creature dedicated to healing others AND 2 additional healing spells... but hardly any offensive spells to speak of, mediocre ranged units, and either slow or fragile melee units. So while your units can survive long, you're not killing many enemies either if your opponent is any good. A level dip to get one of her healing abilities on the other hand is quite useful and she does get access to one of the best titan units in the game.|Sacrifice|2000|VideoGame|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sacrifice

Downplayed with galleys and battleships: galleys do disproportionally high damage to battleships, but still die to them in a one-on-one fight. Until they're replaced by submarines, which can't be targeted by battleships. Most units are very good at killing a specific unit type, decent at killing others, and bad at killing their counters (swordsmen have anti-arrow armor to kill archers, archers kill spearmen at range but can't outrun them, and spearmen have anti-sword armor and high damage). Even then it's not entirely crippling: archers and artillery are the only units that can fire over walls, which can protect them from all melee attacks.

The AM-CORE File Server has the most memory storage (256 Gq) and the fastest available bandwidth (10 Gqs), but can only hold three CPUs, which means the actual hacking process will be slow. The OMEGA Parallel Supercomputer can hold a whopping sixteen CPUs, which will allow it to crack any system extremely fast, but it has only 48 Gq memory, a slow 4 Gqs bandwidth, and only one security slot (which is bad, see Useless Useful Spell, again).

Obfuscating Disability|"the Laughing Man went into hiding by hacking the computers of a mental hospital for children and youths and creating a fake identity of being a patient suffering from severe mental disabilities and being almost unresponsive to other people. Which is particularly ironic as his Calling Card was an image that included the quote from The Catcher in the Rye: ""I thought what I'd do was, I'd pretend I was one of those deaf-mutes."" The context of the quote is more telling still; it's taken from a passage where the narrator decides in a flight of fancy that he'd run away and live a life of seclusion, far from the falseness and ugliness of society."|Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex|2002|Anime|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex

Fictional Disability|"Cyberbrain Sclerosis is a disease that may result when a person's cyberbrain casing doesn't fully integrate the human brain inside it, causing parts to harden, and leading to dementia-like symptoms. It can ultimately be fatal. Togusa mentions in a report that it's basically the new incurable disease of the 21st century, just the same has Tuberculosis, AIDS, and cancer proved to be in the 19th and 20th centuries. A solid part of the first season's plot involves uncovering a conspiracy of a viable cure being suppressed by the government for financial manipulation. Cyberbrain Closed Shell Syndrome is something akin to severe online addiction, in which cyberbrain users simply refuse to interact with meatspace unless they're forced to. This means that Togusa's investigation into a facility that treats patients in ""PORTRAITZ"" has the added wrinkle that the entire grounds are blocked off to help limit the patients' access."|Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex|2002|Anime|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex

Crippling Overspecialization|Many powers that would otherwise be completely overpowering are compensated by the borg in question having almost no ability outside of it. Copy Robot for example has no offense when it isn't using Power Copying, and there are several borgs it can't copy. Gatling Gunner has lots of power and an insane rate of fire, but it reloads slow and its only other offense are basically the same bombs as a Normal Ninja. Ultimate Cannon is capable of performing a One-Hit KO on pretty much anything in the game, but it literally takes a minute to fully charge and it has little offensive or defensive power while it does so. Several of the other partners have this. In particular, Mana focuses so much on support that she has almost no offensive presence whatsoever (though this does mean she's the least likely to Kill Steal; see You Kill It, You Bought It as to why that's valuable), Nekobe's focus on slow melee specialists makes it comically easy to hang back and snipe him, and Yuji's Knuckle Borgs are also fairly reliant on close-to-mid-range combat (though not nearly as much as Nekobe's Knight Borgs), making them fairly simple targets as long as they're not allowed to close in much.

Mad Oracle|Inspect the Malkavian dialogue options after running through the game, and realize that you're actually guessing at what's going on... and you are almost always right. To drive the trope even further, Pisha and Strauss more or less outright state that the Malkavian themself doesn't even know what's going on: They start seeing things and babble about their visions without comprehending their context or what they mean. Given that a Malkavian PC is just as surprised by all the plot twists as all the other characters, despite having spoiled several of them in advance with their visions, they're probably right. Choose the right babbling dialog option with Jack and he'll casually mention that the fact he knows you don't understand it is the only reason he doesn't kill you on the spot to keep that particular secret quiet. Rosa dabbles into this — mostly she's just a bit uncertain because she knows her visions make her a bit weird and she can't always control when they happen, but when she does get visions she's... more or less the Malkavian PC with less agency.

Crippling Overspecialization|Max has a lot of power and good control stats but has low spin and curve. While having a lot of power is nice, especially in long courses like Deep Inferno, you suffer a penalty in control and accuracy stats if you power stat is higher than 20. Uncle Bob has a lot of spin, which is very useful for chip-in opportunities. On the other hand, he has the lowest control stat. Meaning he is the hardest character to hit do perfect shots. And missing a Pangya in this game could result in a disaster. Cecilia has a lot of curve and her other stats are average. While this is good for Silvia Cannon, this stat is the most useless one by a huge margin, considering curve shots are only useful in a very few holes.|Pangya|2004|VideoGame|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pangya
Crippling Overspecialization|Somewhat literally played with the Hammerman and Jumpman badges—each grants 1 extra damage for either Hammer or Jump attacks in exchange for being incapable of using the other.

Crippling Overspecialization|"The earth flower is really useful in dark underground levels, as it gives Tux a ""safety helmet"" equipped with a little lamp. Obviously, that lamp is effectless in a fully lit environment. Even in a partially lit scene it can be more debilitating than useful because the bright light cone impairs perception of things outside of it. Plus you need a relatively even floor for it to be most effective - small platforms with bottomless pits are difficult to cross because you can't direct the light diagonally... Yeah, the earth flower also has other nice effects - it gives you an extra hitpoint (like the other flower powerups), and allows you to ""petrify"" briefly and become invulnerable. Hitting the key combination for triggering the petrification at the right moment is difficult, however."|Supertux|2004|VideoGame|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Supertux

Just before your fight against Chomp Country (notable for having high Attack and Defense), another cake arrives. If you eat the second one thinking it's safe, you're forced to fight the next battle alone, without any of your partners. If ignored, Shellshock takes the poison instead.

He certainly doesn't seem ugly enough to have spent much of his childhood in a freak show. IMDb points out that in real 19th-century Europe, people with deformities at least as bad as the Phantom's were actually pretty common, so it's not realistic that his face would elicit that much shock and horror.|The Phantom of the Opera (2004)|2004|Film|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePhantomOfTheOpera2004

Handicapped Badass|Getting maimed only reduces a general's Martial stat by 2, meaning that your best general will still remain a great asskicker even if they lose a limb or two. This will affect his future health, though. In addition, while losing a limb gives a severe penalty to personal combat skill, a character with many traits that boost personal combat skill won't be too badly affected by this loss, and the penalties for losing an arm or leg can be offset by acquiring a prosthesis like a peg leg or iron hand. Averted in the case of blindness. Characters hoping to be a Blind Weaponmaster will have to contend with a devastating -100 personal combat skill. While it's possible to be a competent fighter with such a penalty with everything else going your way, being a master duelist is pretty much out of the question.

Crippling Overspecialization|Due to the way damage works in the first game, characters are generally only good at dealing one type of damage: either physical, energy, or mental. As the game progresses, you will often encounter enemies that either resist or are outright immune to a certain type of damage, which really reduces the usefulness of bringing certain characters on missions. Psychics end up suffering the most since the last third or so of the game is populated mostly by Sentinel enemies, who resist mental damage. Thankfully, the 2nd game took steps to fix this and many characters are able to deal more than one type of damage.|X-Men Legends II|2005|VideoGame|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XMenLegendsII
Crippling Overspecialization|Gobblers and Evil Eyes have pitiful stats in every category except HP and SP, respectively. Their weapon proficiencies are either suited to better classes with the stats to use them or work against their one strength. Idols and Heaven's Blisses are amazing healer-types with an overabundance of RES, MV, and SP. They're also amazingly useless at every form of combat. Unless you happen upon a Syringe and have some Mana to spare... Guardians and Iron Golems are immensely tough to hurt but can't really deal any damage. This is especially bad since the game prevents units from blocking one another, turning the heavily-armored tanks into paperweights. Guardians are however one of the two generic classes that can use a Beam Sword - Something to consider for Reincarnation.

Crippling Overspecialization|Various unique items have stats that are only effective on very specialized builds. For instance, Painweaver is a bow that reduces the opponent's Defensive Ability by 80%, but Defensive Ability affects melee attacks only, meaning that the player character needs pets or a second weapon to take advantage of the benefit. More examples can be found here. The game discourages Min-Maxing by making some encounters of the game really hard. Ghosts have high resistance to physical attacks. Device- and Undead-class enemies have high resistances (or are downright immune) to damage types such as Poison, Bleeding, and Vitality. A player who dumps all of their attribute points in Dexterity to maximize Poison and Bleeding damage, for instance, will struggle to beat enemies of the wrong class.

Crippling Overspecialization|Many nations have their own unique fighting styles and tactics: England are masters of the longbow and heavy brawling infantry; Spain specializes in pikes and gunpowder troops; Germany develops anti-armor mace weapons and greatsword infantry to fight pikes. France stands out however, as masters of heavy lance on horseback combat: they field the finest mounted knights in the world through all ages culminating in the plate-armored heavy lancers. Unfortunately, this specialization is mostly only effective against the old medieval tactics of light armored spear infantry armies. The French mounted knights all carry swords in brawling combat which are weak against armor, making them all but useless against their equally armored mace-wielding German counterparts; English longbowmen can pick them off at a distance, and charging them against Spanish pikemen is an act of pure suicide. The French try to compensate for this in later ages by adopting some of the weapons and tactics of their neighbors, however they are still Master of None.|Medieval II: Total War|2006|VideoGame|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MedievalIITotalWar

Armor has the slowest vehicles and is extremely vulnerable to air units, but firepower and hardiness gives it ground superiority. Support is deficient at direct close-combat, but it provides the crucial anti-air units that prevent the rest of the team from being slaughtered by helicopters. Support also has repair tanks and artillery, with the latter's usefulness being highly situational. Air is highly mobile and destructive, but the role is very vulnerable to anti-air, and air units can't capture control points.|World in Conflict|2007|VideoGame|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldInConflict

Artificial Limbs|The cyborg Ghor only has 6% of his original body left, having replaced most of it with mechanical appendages. He displays a bit of Cybernetics Eat Your Soul — his personality changes from a fairly gentle and intelligent demeanor (it's noted that he will work for free or give bounty money to the victims of those he hunts) to aggressive and violent when he merges with his armorsuit, though he maintains control of himself as seen on Norion (where the player sees him both in and out of his suit — out of the suit, he calmly informs Samus of a tactical decision, while in the suit he starts shouting at her to get a move on to the objective while brandishing weapons). Justified in that the suit could be designed to alter his personality to make him more aggressive, as it's noted in his scan entry that he isn't a proficient fighter without it. However, after his corruption, he does get a terminal case of straight Cybernetics Eat Your Soul as seen when, without his suit, he gloats and causes some destruction to hinder Samus but is easily fended off (and even makes a remark while retreating that could show he's not yet fully corrupted), but in his suit he goes full-on berserker, going as far as to throw Samus' gunship at her.|Metroid Prime 3: Corruption|2007|VideoGame|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime3Corruption
Crippling Overspecialization|Blooper has an excellent changeup pitch, but all his stats are decent at best, making him struggle to find a spot on teams. Subverted with Bowser. His stats imply this, with a maximum 10 in Bat and no other stat above 5. However, Bat is important enough that he would be usable even with no hidden advantages, and he has two of those anyway. First are his tremendous fielding throws, which are the fastest in the game. He also has fantastic chemistry with every single member of the Bowser Monsters (as well as Koopa Troopa and Koopa Paratroopa). When two players have chemistry, their fielding throws are faster: not only do Bowser's lasers get even quicker, but his teammates get throwing boosts as well. However, while Bowser's Chemistry matchups with his team are the best, at the same time he has the most bad chemistry matchups of all the characters, making him a wildcard that is either a great or a poor fit based on how the team is built. Bowser's super-fast throws can go off-target if he plays with someone he doesn't get along with. Zig-zagged with Peach. She specializes in pitching, with a 9/10 stat tied with Boo for the highest. The Pitch stat is not important as Bat, but her 8/10 Field stat and Quick Throw ability seem to give her a secondary strength. In practice, though, she is not a great fielder. The Field stat is the least impactful, and Quick Throw may be the least impactful ability. Besides a workable Field stat, fielders want secondary attributes like special dives, height, high Run (for outfielders), and chemistry with other strong infielders (for infielders). Peach has decent enough height and chemistry with Daisy, but she has no special dive and her Run is middling. Characters like Yoshi and Petey Piranha are much better at outfield and infield, respectively, despite their average gloves because they have more of those advantages. Thus, Peach is usually heavily outclassed as a fielder. However, if Stars are enabled, her excellent Star Swing in Heart Swing can turn her into a reliable base hitter, averting this trope. Even without Stars, her pitching expertise may make her strong on certain teams and in certain situations, but she becomes trickier to justify. Baby Peach, lacking her older self's unique Star Swing, plays this trope more straight. Again, though, her pitching may be enough to merit her a spot depending on the team and situation. The default Yoshi Eggs lineup specializes in speed but loses out on most everything else. You're sorely lacking in batting power (Birdo and Wiggler are your only strong options), pitching (5/10 Blue Shy Guy is your best), and chemistry (most everyone likes Birdo, but that's your only positive chemistry, and Yoshis and Shy Guys dislike each other).|Mario Super Sluggers|2008|VideoGame|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioSuperSluggers
Crippling Overspecialization|Every class is restricted to certain types of weapons. This means that Lancers can't carry a carbine as a backup weapon for dealing with infantry. Later on, Lancers can have the option of taking mortar lances that are more effective against infantry, with the obvious tradeoff in mortars being less effective against tanks. More to the point, Lancers and Snipers don't carry any weapon besides AT Lances and Sniper Rifles respectively  not even a handgun. This means that during the enemy's turn, they don't lay down interception fire or return fire when shot at.|Valkyria Chronicles|2008|VideoGame|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyriaChronicles

Crippling Overspecialization|The Aeroglider/Jetsetter suffers from this. It's got a great top speed stat and weighs a lot, but has the worst stats for drifting, handling, acceleration, offroad and mini turbos. So while it's fast, it can barely turn, flies off the road when drifting, and takes forever to get back to top speed after taking a hit. This means that if the player is racing on a track with lots of corners or item boxes, using the Aeroglider is basically guaranteeing they'll get last place.|Mario Kart Wii|2008|VideoGame|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKartWii

They carry great amounts of powerful air-to-ground weapons and have thick armor and considerable speed and stability, but their mobility suffers greatly for this and they're poorly suited to dogfighting. The Senryu SS is basically Character Exaggeration of the base model Senryu - it's even more armored, even less agile to the point that no amount of tuning can make it remotely competitive in a turning fight, and its two guns fire even slower than the base Senryu's two guns, such that it has trouble fighting, even when using Tactical Maneuver Commands. The Itsuha takes it the exact opposite way - it's fast and extremely agile, but it has tiny SP weapon loads, nearly non-existent stability, and poor defense, making it hard to actually point where you want and extremely fragile if it starts taking fire. Ukumori's Itsuha takes this even further.

He's a fairly unrealistic depiction of a sufferer, given he hasn't managed to hideously damage himself accidentally during childhood. He appears to specifically have the ""indifference"" rather than the ""insensitivity"" version - this means the sufferer is aware of pain as a sensation associated with personal harm, but it does not hurt as it does for a non-sufferer. His complaining about a headache (due to his exposure to the virus) seems to reflect that he finds the sensation annoying, while the other cases where he ""feels pain"" are mechanical reactions to extreme physical trauma, e.g. the kind from the infection that drives everyone else mad."|darkSector|2008|VideoGame|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSector

When he presents this evidence at the end of the Chapter, she proves to be perfectly able to hear him, confirming his suspicions.|Limbo of the Lost|2008|VideoGame|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LimboOfTheLost

An Arm and a Leg|During the initial attempt to get the Prawns to sign the eviction forms, one poor guard ends up getting his arm torn off when a Prawn loses his temper and attacks. If the alien guns don't outright gib who they hit, they're losing a limb at least. Most prominently is the scene where Wikus rescues Christopher using the mech suit. For good measure, the mech stomps on the arm. Wikus attempts to chop his arm off, believing it'll stop his metamorphosis, but he only manages to get a finger off and stops due to the pain. The Nigerian gang boss tries to have his arm cut off twice, under the mistaken belief it'll grant him the power to operate the alien weapons.|District 9|2009|Film|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/District9
Ignore the Disability|"Used with a twist. Wraith warns Logan not to mention Dukes' extreme weight gain, as he is sensitive about it. The very first thing that Logan says is ""Hey, Fat uh, Fred!"" It's clearly accidental, but as Dukes doesn't seem to care, Logan continues doing it on purpose, calling him ""Slim"" and the like. Logan doesn't hit the Berserk Button until he uses the word Bub, which Dukes mishears as Blob. The joke here is that Fred Dukes is a long-standing Marvel Comics villain, who uses the identity ""The Blob""."|X-Men Origins: Wolverine|2009|Film|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenOriginsWolverine

Crippling Overspecialization|Many ships loadouts' can leave them this way; missile boats can be very vulnerable to fighters and plasma ships can be easily picked off by fast frigates and fighters; meanwhile, a cruiser or frigate outfitted with certain beam weapons will be helpless against cruisers that buff up their armor or shields, and fighters that lack armor penetrating weapons will not be able to damage heavy cruisers very well - but if they are equipped with armor-piercing weapons, they're hard-pressed to fight enemy fighters. The balancing act between fleets is very delicate. Nowhere is this more evident than in the Challenge mode, where many players assemble near-invincible fleets that are nonetheless vulnerable to a particular fleet configuration. Particularly - and annoyingly - common is the challenge that consists entirely of blocks of cruisers equipped with missiles/plasma, defense lasers to stop fighters, and strong shields. The natural response is high-speed cruisers with plenty of guidance scramblers; the Swarm even have a module, the Smart Bomb Pulse Generator, that destroys all missiles in its radius, specifically to render missile-block fleets irrelevant.|Gratuitous Space Battles|2009|VideoGame|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GratuitousSpaceBattles

Crippling Overspecialization|Stacking one stat in this game will generally just make you extremely vulnerable or easily countered. Only a very few amount of champions have a gameplay style that encourages getting only one stat until you might as well upgrade to other items that give more in addition to them. It's possible to force the enemy team to overspecialize. Pick an assassin or nuker and have a good early game to the point where the enemy is forced to buy resistance items specifically to counter you. While this leaves you fairly useless, the entire enemy team is now hundreds of gold behind or you could single out the one person that didn't buy resistances yet.|League of Legends|2009|VideoGame|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LeagueOfLegends

Crippling Overspecialization|Most tank destroyers sacrifice their turrets for the ability to mount powerful and accurate guns, and increased camouflage. SPGs can fire shells beyond standard view range and over limited cover; at the cost of rate of fire, accuracy, and endurance. Ammunition for their cannons is also very expensive and they cannot carry many into battle. HEAT rounds for Artillery are also this, as you can get enough penetration to do full damage with your shells against better armored targets, but lose splash damage, so near misses or ricochets do nothing. Most light tanks are fast but lack the armor to take on anything but other light tanks and artillery with reliability. Most heavy tanks have heavy armor and/or large and powerful guns. They are also slow moving, large and easy to hit, have turrets that turn slowly and long reload times. If caught in the open, they can be picked apart by constant bombardment.

Crippling Overspecialization|"Most Cats that specialize in dealing critical hits are notoriously weak against non-Metal enemies, as they're meant to target the raw health pools of Armored But Frail enemies while dealing double damage. This even extends to most critical hit Ubers. The special Ubers from the ""Busters"" banners, like Strike Unit R.E.I. or Sakura Sonic, can crush any enemy that they target. However, with the exception of Pai-Pai, they're very poor in terms of general use, if you use them anyway. Ubers that only hit enemies with specific traits, like Takeda Shingen or Warlock & Pierre. They can destroy most enemies that they target, but are helpless against anything else. Some of Ototo's custom Cat Cannons, like the Waterblast or Holy Blast cannons, fall under this. They can devastate Metal and Zombie enemies, respectively, but are completely useless against anything else.

Crippling Overspecialization|"The ""anti-tank"" class in Battlefield 2 suffers from this. The ability to attack vehicles from afar comes at the price of being horrible at fighting off infantry. This is somewhat averted by the vanilla unlock for the AT class in Battlefield 2, the DAO. As a semi-auto shotgun with 12 rounds is it absolutely devastating at close range. Beyond approximately six inches it is pretty useless though. Another example? Also unexpectedly suffered by the Assault class in Battlefield 2, which is meant to be the game's plain combat-oriented rifleman class, only to end up relatively less-played because it's only good at infantry vs infantry combat and useless against any vehicle that isn't a transport car. Several other classes can do that while also having additional useful abilities. When the Special Forces expansion introduced the game breaking G36E it caused a mass exit from Assault to Medic because the medic heal ability is much more useful than the nerfed grenade launcher. Unsurprisingly later games in the series made sure to give the Assault more useful and unique abilities and equipment, Battlefield 2142 eventually decided to combine the two classes into one character to give players choice over which type to use, until Battlefield 1, which brought back the medic class and made the Assault a buffed version of Battlefield 2's anti-tank."|Battlefield|2011|VideoGame|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield
Crippling Overspecialization|The unmutated Mercenaries found near the end of the game all use firearms, so while they have a lot of health, they can be easily taken down with melee weapons. Some of the playable characters are also saddled with this at first as their special ability is only useful later on in the game. Hellraiser deals +10% damage in heavy weapons and explosives, however, he is useless in the beginning (where you'll probably find him) since the earliest suitable weapon he benefits from cannot be found until Level 7 (Frag Grenades) so he only becomes viable near the endgame. Sarsy's special ability lets him use cloak for twice as long (see Invisibility below). Downplayed as Cloak Trigger can be found after Level 4, making him more useful if you're going down that playstyle path, as Cloak and the Cattle Prod (also available in the same area) makes him a very good pacifist character. Afritana is a hacker who, if she's equipped with the skill Auto Hack, deals damage to Mechanical Enemies three times quicker without ever touching them. Good luck getting by until Level 9, when that's available!|Legends Of Kong|2011|VideoGame|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegendsOfKong
Crippling Overspecialization|While the game supports many different build types, some are better than others in the last act fighting against the zombie horde. For example, a stealth build will cause lots of problems for you due to lack of shields preventing zombies from infesting your ships should they catch wind of where you are. Some stations and ships use missiles exclusively. Equipping all your ships with Point Defense Modules makes them big fat roadblocks that innefectually spit rockets at you.

Handicapped Badass|Getting maimed only reduces a general's Martial stat by 2, meaning that your best general will still remain a great asskicker even if they lose a limb or two. This will affect his future health, though. In addition, while losing a limb gives a severe penalty to personal combat skill, a character with many traits that boost personal combat skill won't be too badly affected by this loss, and the penalties for losing an arm or leg can be offset by acquiring a prosthesis like a peg leg or iron hand. Averted in the case of blindness. Characters hoping to be a Blind Weaponmaster will have to contend with a devastating -100 personal combat skill. While it's possible to be a competent fighter with such a penalty with everything else going your way, being a master duelist is pretty much out of the question.

Crippling Overspecialization|The Fighter and Warrior classes can suffer from this. Their main strengths are that they can take and dish out a lot of physical damage. Unfortunately, they lack any form of ranged attacks, which is a severe handicap against the multitude of flying enemies in this game. The Mage and Sorcerer classes have this, but only in a rare few situations. Some enemies, such as the Golem and Metal Golem, are resistant to any form of elemental magic to the point of almost total immunity, which is the main form of offense for both classes. The Sorcerer mitigates this a bit, as some of their spells are able to cause physical damage as well as elemental. For mages, your only option is the Frigor spell or whacking its weak points with your staff. That, or punching it. Players and Pawns who stick with one vocation throughout the game will see very limited stat growth in areas beyond those the vocation prioritizes. Remaining a Mage or Sorcerer throughout the game will yield incredible Magick and Magick Defense stats but very low Defense and unremarkable Stamina. Thus it's advisable to change vocations frequently to foster balanced stat growth. The Mage and Sorcerer classes have this, but only in a rare few situations.

Crippling Overspecialization|Voltar, a floating brain in a jar who focuses mainly upon healing, is this. Unable to purposefully do any damage at all to the enemy without upgrades (at least, until patch 2.10, which let his basic attack damage enemies by default), he instead relies upon AI drones that follow him around to inflict damage. Gnaw's reliance on Damage over Time leaves him very ineffective against healers and passive regeneration upgrades like Med-i-Can. His Weedlings are also vulnerable to big AoE effects that can wipe them out in one hit. Any character that uses large amounts of crowd control have their effectiveness reduced by Baby Kuri Mammoth, a utility item available to every character.

Crippling Overspecialization|"Bombardiers (Magellan, Napoleon, Galileo) can only hit the furthest back two columns of the enemy formation with their regular attacks. If they don't learn skills that allow them to attack closer, they're useless against front-line fighters. Gunners (and Kay) have a similar problem in that they can only hit targets within the same row, but are at least able to re-position themselves if need be. Most Magic users are excellent at building up the Brave metre, but rarely pack enough fire-power to be competent at taking down enemies. The Ancient Heroes, apart from Takeru who is an absolute Lightning Bruiser with no weakness, all excels at one particular aspect while falling short in the others. The most egregious example being Hercules, who scores 12 in attack, but only 2 in defence and 3 in speed, leaving her with the second-worst overall stats in the whole game. Oddly enough, the final boss Nyarlathotep herself also falls into this category. She only has two skills: ""Charge"", which gives her 2 Brave Orbs, but has a charge-up time and can be easily interrupted, and ""Creeping Chaos"", which is a terrifying One-Hit Kill attack costing 10 Brave Orbs. This setup makes her pretty much an ""all or nothing"" unit, meaning that she will either annihilates your party with ease, or gets perpetually stuck with a unfilled Brave Meter and unable to fight back because your character with the Mana Drain skill is constantly sucking her dry.

Crippling Overspecialization|"Heavies in general qualify - their LMGs pack a lot of punch compared to the standard assault rifles used by Assaults and Supports, and their rockets are not only highly effective against clusters of early alien bad guys due to their high damage and wide area of effect, but they also deny the tougher enemies their cover, leaving them vulnerable to be picked off. Heavies with the ""Holo Targeting"" skill are fantastic babysitters for low-ranking squaddies with bad Aim, helping them get those vital kills. By mid-game, you'll still find Heavies fairly useful in the role of fire support, but it'll be your Snipers and Assaults getting the big kill counts. They come back into use in the late game where HEAT Ammo gives them bonuses against the increasingly-common robotic enemies, but are nowhere near the killing machines they once were, even when you get the Blaster Launcher. By choosing the appropriate abilities and equipment you could easily create highly specialized troopers of any class: supports that are great at healing and not very good at anything else, snipers that are great at long range with good positioning but terrible in close combat, and assaults that are great at close combat but very poor at a distance. There are also plenty of equipment useful in a very specific situation and pretty useless otherwise. Reaper ammunition is good before you get lasers, but are at most inventory filler for Council requests otherwise. A ghost grenade is just what you need if you have a few exposed troopers standing near each other by the end of the turn and your other troops are much harder to hit; in other situations, it's not even worth using even when you've brought it. Needle grenades are great for hurting plenty of enemies that do not have cover compared to where the grenade lands, otherwise it's a waste of Chryssalid corpses that you could be using for Chitin Plating. Nano-fiber vests add 2 HP to a soldier's health pool. Useful very early on, but a drop in a bucket later on. The Respirator Implant does its job better and also negates the poison from Chryssalids and Thin Men and the strangulation attack of Seekers. To a non-psionic, a mind shield is a great thing to have when facing psi attacks, but useless otherwise, especially if you have the right gene mods (Neural Damping, for example, negates mind control completely)."|XCOM: Enemy Unknown|2012|VideoGame|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOMEnemyUnknown
Crippling Overspecialization|Many units have only one useful role, and are mincemeat for anything that isn't their sole counter. Examples include anti-air or anti-tank missile vehicles. Averted realistically by some units; infantry carry anti-tank or anti-air missiles, assault rifles, and grenades and a good infantry unit is capable of taking on a surprising range of units. Also, certain tanks come with autocannons as well as machine guns, making them effective against vehicles, aircraft, and infantry all in one. The best example of this would be the M60 Starship, whose main gun can fire both conventional ammo and anti-tank missiles, and also packs a 20mm autocannon to use against helicopters.|Wargame: European Escalation|2012|VideoGame|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WargameEuropeanEscalation

The Flintlock Staff is the biggest example, having a powerful charged shot that can hit from about 120 meters away, but terrible continuous fire and a melee attack that does almost no damage. It doesn't help that many enemies spawn from much shorter distances, preventing you from simply cheesing big open areas and long hallways by sniping everything before they notice you. The opposite of staves is the club weapon category. Clubs specialize in melee attacks and have charged shots that can pummel enemies around you and in front of you into oblivion, but don't fire projectiles at all during their continuous fire. On top of that, clubs have the worst attack range in Air Battles, preventing you from killing a large plurality of enemies.|Kid Icarus: Uprising|2012|VideoGame|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KidIcarusUprising

Informed Deformity|"Eir Stegalkin, the Norn member of Destiny's Edge, is constantly referred to as old — this is how she looks for overall design◊. Of course, according to the lore, norn seem to be rather long-lived, so Eir might be ""old"" only when compared to humans. Dialogue between a hunter in Hoelbrak and a shaman suggests that ""age"", as the norn view it, is not measured in years but by the capacity to complete deeds. A hunter who has accomplished many things in life, but who has sustained great injury that limits his ability to live up to his youth, is said to have progressed in ""seasons"", and is encouraged to devote their time training others or passing on wisdom as a transition from that youth. Because Eir had accomplished things which most norn could not hope to match, but has since refused to pursue that goal, she may be considered ""old"" by society (and indeed likely considers herself to be old) and thus passes her experience and wisdom to the Slayer as a result. Take a close look at human NPCs that are labeled as Old Women◊. Since there aren't any faces for older people, they really look more like white-haired girls. With the correct starting face and judicious use of appearance sliders, you can create the face of an old man or old woman.

Crippling Overspecialization|"There are a few points you run into this. The main one is overall team build. Each character has colors they use to power their abilities, as well as how much damage they do with that color when matched. If you place too many characters on your team that use the same color, you will suffer from a lack of AP in some colors while other AP just builds up uselessly. A good example would be Invisible Woman and She-Hulk. Both characters are solid support characters, but both of them use green and blue heavily to do their job. This can lead to one character starving for AP and unable to do their job properly. Some characters can do this as well. The now infamous ""Bagman Spiderman"" is a very good example of this, due to having two abilities that were best suited against countdown tiles, and his one useful move was very expensive, taking 14 AP or one AP less than Half of your AP limit, and hardly ever worth the cost of using it. And speaking of which, the minions themselves count, as their only job is to spawn countdown tiles. They cannot make any matches and constantly gain AP each turn to make up for it. This makes a few setups very potent against them, and even characters who can't do anything against countdown against them still have a chance of matching and destroying them before they go off."|Marvel Puzzle Quest|2013|VideoGame|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelPuzzleQuest

Crippling Overspecialization|Played straight. Fighters can take down enemy aircraft with ease, but are less than useless against any ground targets harder than an armored car without any bombs or rockets. Whilst tanks do tend to have poor top armour, aircraft guns generally can't get a good enough angle to punch through them. Mounting rockets or bombs on a fighter greatly reduces its agility. Attackers can engage anything, but pay for it as they are usually slower than fighters, but lack the armor of a bomber. Float Planes can only land on water. Which is great if you need to set down, not so great if you're trying to capture a runway in Domination Mode. Flying Boats, though, can easily belly-land on a runway, and most of them are so hard to kill that a capture is almost assured. Bombers can carry a large number of bombs, but must rely on their gunners to take down fighters that attack them, and are typically very slow. In real life, bombers were typically guarded by escort fighters that would either accompany them to the target or sweep the area ahead of them and engage anything getting close, but since these are other players we're talking about, well... needless to say, most of the time, you're on your own. Some bombers are actually frightfully good at averting this. Due to incredibly tough hulls and fairly heavy turreted armament, it's possible for some heavy bombers to rack up more air kills than a decently competent player in a fighter simply by... flying straight. If you're ever attacking a bomber and it suddenly levels out, that's a good sign to call a retreat; this often means that the player has switched to manual control of the turrets and is about to focus all his firepower right on you. Using Japanese Bombers is complicated by the fact that they have two separate types of bombs. The gist is that AP Bombs are for Ships only while Ground Bombs are for Ground Units only. Anti-Air trucks are good for killing planes, capping ground zones, and not much else. The ZiS-30 trades armor, maneuverability, gun handling, and ammo load for a gun that can easily kill tanks a full rank higher than it. Most tank destroyers in general trade a turret in exchange for mounting a larger gun than that chassis could normally mount. Not a problem at longer ranges, a huge problem when that light tank has managed to outflank you... Averted of course for the American destroyers, which have semi-enclosed turrets. This comes at the cost of thinner armor vulnerable to SPAA fire, though. And the open-top turrets mean any fighter can kill the crew via strafing. The Type 93 SAM is essentially a Japanese short range surface-to-air missile launcher mounted on a very fast but unarmored utility vehicle. Unlike other Anti-Air vehicles, it lacks any sort of gun or manually-guided missile to engage ground targets in a pinch (its missiles won't even fire unless they lock on an aircraft), making it hopeless in a fight against enemy ground vehicles.

Crippling Overspecialization|A definite possibility with certain nation-, type-, or era-specific decks. There is no such thing as a perfectly balanced deck, and much of the fun in deck-building is figuring out a specialization you want to play, and covering its weaknesses as best as you can. Most SAM systems have no real ability to fight ground targets outside of maybe a machine gun for fighting infantry and unarmoured vehicles. As well, many ATGM tank destroyers lack a pintle machine gun, meaning they can't engage anything but other vehicles, leaving them open to attack by infantry or helicopters if left unsupported. Averted by the Canadian ADATS, whose missiles can target both air and ground vehicles. Most anti-tank and anti-air weapons teams. While most have a rifle or submachine gun for defence, their small size means they will be outgunned if they run into a proper infantry section, anti-tank teams have no real defence against helicoptersnote normal sections, while weak to them, can use their machine gun if a helicopter gets close, which is likely to happen if they are in a forest, and SAM teams have no defence against any ground vehicle with even a small amount of armour (and even unarmoured vehicles if they have a machine gun).|Wargame: AirLand Battle|2013|VideoGame|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WargameAirlandBattle

Crippling Overspecialization|The Martian Kataphrakts, despite their overwhelming power, all suffer from this, each has a single powerful ability but nothing else, so if that ability is countered they don't have much to fall back on. Later on when several Knights start working together, complimenting their abilities and covering for each other, it starts creating major problems for the protagonists. The Nilokeras has a completely impenetrable shield that disintegrates anything it touches but  this also means it can't see either, since no light can get through, so it needs an open patch to receive drone telemetry, making it especially vulnerable to smoke grenades.. The only weapon equipped by the Argyre is its massive beam katana, which lets it slice through earth Kataphrakt armor like butter and even stop bullets. However,  Inaho uses explosive reactive armor to temporarily disperse the plasma blade, allowing him to get in close and grapple the Kataphrakt. He then turns its plasma swords against it by causing it to fall into the ocean along with his mech while he ejects. The blades super-heat the water and cause a steam explosion, destroying both Kataphrakts. The Hellas can engage multiple targets with its nearly invulnerable attack drones but has no other weapons if they are destroyed. The Elysium Kataphrakt only has the ability to project a seemingly impassable field that rapidly freezes opponents and ammo within a 1km range, but is easily dispatched if you can close the distance where it's ability can't work in time. Saazbaum's Dioscuria  combines the abilities of all 3 previous Season 1 models but also combines all of their weaknesses, and actually manages to add more exploitable weaknesses due to having to use the abilities one at a time. This allows Inaho to exploit them as much as possible to get an edge in battle. Twice. Count Mazuurek's Sirenum can project waves of gravitational force that deflects all attacks, removes air from the local environment, and tears anything close to it to pieces but has a blind spot directly above it. The Solis can project incredibly powerful and long-range energy beams in a steady stream or rapid-fire bursts, allowing it to shoot down incoming opponents and missiles with ease. But  it's lasers can only shoot in straight lines and thus can't stop artillery fire from over the horizon. The Herschel can deploy multiple Attack Drones to fire from every direction at once, but is less effective in confined spaces where the drones cannot spread out or maneuver, making them easy to shoot down, and if it loses its drones, all it has left is a single beam rifle. The Ortygia has an amazing cloning ability, but like the Nilokeras & the Elysium, it carries no weapons and its only attack is to punch its enemies in the face. The Electris can use electricity for powerful offensive and defensive abilities, but this is completely negated if you match potential with it. The Scandia has almost perfect optical (and functionally perfect sensory) camouflage but no armor. Inaho finds it by using smoke grenades and looking for air disturbances from the mech's movements. Averted with it's second appearance where it carries a second Kataphrakt to make up it's weaknesses while sharing its invisibility. It's still fragile though. The Octantis's only weapons are a pair of Killer YoYos. They can cut through anything and block anything by spinning really fast, but they are limited to attacking or defending along only one axis, which is a big problem in a three-dimensional environment like outer space and leaves it vulnerable to being hit from another direction. The Tharsis, piloted by Slaine, is aversion. It has no easily-exploited weakness as a general combat unit with no special abilities other than Combat Clairvoyance. But as demonstrated during the duel with the Herschel, this ability can be overwhelmed when facing too many opponents at once. Inaho finds another weakness, namely that Slaine has to be able see the threat in order for it to be effective, meaning that he can be caught up in the rocket anchor cables after dodging the initial projectile. The (original) Deucalion also counts as an aversion, as the only reason it was defeated was due to the cataclysmic events of Heaven's Fall. Prior to that, its gravity manipulation provided perfect defence, a powerful offensive weapon, and flight. This even applies to Martian society as a whole. They have the tech to control gravity, break the speed of light barrier, reverse entropy, and replicate matter, but they can't seem to use it for anything beyond building weapons. The result is a civilization that can make some cool robot suits, but can't even feed itself. The only weapon equipped by the Argyre is its massive beam katana, which lets it slice through earth Kataphrakt armor like butter and even stop bullets. However,  Inaho uses explosive reactive armor to temporarily disperse the plasma blade, allowing him to get in close and grapple the Kataphrakt. He then turns its plasma swords against it by causing it to fall into the ocean along with his mech while he ejects. The blades super-heat the water and cause a steam explosion, destroying both Kataphrakts. Saazbaum's Dioscuria  combines the abilities of all 3 previous Season 1 models but also combines all of their weaknesses, and actually manages to add more exploitable weaknesses due to having to use the abilities one at a time. This allows Inaho to exploit them as much as possible to get an edge in battle. Twice. The Herschel can deploy multiple Attack Drones to fire from every direction at once, but is less effective in confined spaces where the drones cannot spread out or maneuver, making them easy to shoot down, and if it loses its drones, all it has left is a single beam rifle. The Ortygia has an amazing cloning ability, but like the Nilokeras & the Elysium, it carries no weapons and its only attack is to punch its enemies in the face. The Octantis's only weapons are a pair of Killer YoYos. They can cut through anything and block anything by spinning really fast, but they are limited to attacking or defending along only one axis, which is a big problem in a three-dimensional environment like outer space and leaves it vulnerable to being hit from another direction.

At the crescendo of her broadcast speech, Asseylum appears to do this, stepping out of her wheelchair as she triumphantly declares her accession to the throne of Vers. However, she was never actually disabled to begin with, nor had she been Obfuscating Disability; her sister Lemrina, who had been impersonating her during her coma, actually is disabled, so she'd had to pretend that the events of Episode 12 had left her paraplegic. Then in Episode 24, Lemrina herself steps right out of her wheelchair to protest as a dejected Slaine tells the Orbital Knights to surrender. Justified, as it is shown that the hangar they're in is a gravity-free zone and thus Lemrina would not have to use any leg strength to remain standing.|Aldnoah.Zero|2014|Anime|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AldnoahZero

Crippling Overspecialization|"Small players only excel at running the bases fast. The rest of their stats are worthless. Why? They don't field better unlike the Normal type, they don't hit strong, their pitches are slow and inefficient, and worst of all: their special ability in batting? It's called ""Quick dash"", and makes the player run faster than normal towards first base. But it's almost always a ground ball to the infielders, who will most likely put you out anyway. So you'll probably only use them to get doubles instead of singles when that tiny time gap that would put out any normal runner allows the small character ro reach second base just in time. Macho pitchers have faster pitches in general. But their array consists of fastball (which is ridiculously prone to be hit), slow ball (more of the same thing) and curveball. If you use one of these pitchers, you will most likely end up with a ton of hits and runs against you. Downplayed, though, because they can still bat with great strength, so they're not completely useless. But they run slow. Macho pitchers have faster pitches in general.

Crippling Overspecialization|Since you're limited to ten abilities total (two per member), a character who is very good at one role is often less preferable to a character who can easily fit multiple roles, such as offense and healing/mitigation. Even if a character is going to be doing the role of dedicated DPS, it can be helpful if they have the ability to bring something like Shellga or Power Breakdown to contribute more than just damage output. This hit Aria in the game's early years. Her Soul Breaks all have the gimmick of making the party more resistant to Fire damage, so against a boss that prominently uses Fire, she's outstanding — if they don't, she's subpar. Her later Relics transitioned her to a more generalist White Mage role.|Final Fantasy Record Keeper|2014|VideoGame|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyRecordKeeper
Crippling Overspecialization|Zeke is a good melee fighter, able to rack up lots of damage on a group without any defences. But in a game where every ranged unit gets to throw in a free shot at any battle fought in their range? His lack of a shield tends to get in the way of doing anything useful.

Crippling Overspecialization|"""VS"" Weapon Skills will only give you bonus damage when used against a specific class of enemy; e.g., ""VS Legend"" increases damage against Link, Zelda, Ganondorf, and Young Link (and Toon Link and Linkle in Legends). The most overspecialized of all is ""VS Ganon"", which solely affects Dark Beast Ganon, who is easily the least common giant boss in the game. In Legends and Definitive Edition it also works on Phantom Ganon and Yuga, but that's only a mild improvement."|Hyrule Warriors|2014|VideoGame|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HyruleWarriors
Crippling Overspecialization|A big weakness for Build Burning Gundam, as it is completely reliant on hand to hand combat and has no ranged weapons whatsoever. Lampshaded in episode 5. Yuuma wonders how Team Angelfish, which uses all aquatic mobile suits to be unbeatable underwater, could manage in any of the fields that don't have any water.Yuuma: What would they have even done if the battlefield had been space? Team Angelfish's strategy for non-water battlefields is revealed in episode 7: when they end up on a stage where all the water is frozen over they all blow up their mobile suits rather than be on the wrong end of a Curb-Stomp Battle. In episode 6, Team SRSC select units to specifically counter the heroes' Gunpla. So when Fumina busts out the Winning Road system to power up her teammates, SRSC gets overpowered by the new abilities they had no counter for. Fumina and Yuuma deal with this problem in episode 12 - Fumina's focus on powering up everyone else makes her crumble when she has to deal with something on her own; and as the sniper, Yuuma panics whenever an enemy closes in on him.

Admittedly, that doesn't qualify as a disability, but after a coma there's usually lots of physical therapy needed to get the person acclimated to using their muscles again. It's referenced the moment he attempts to leave his chair and falls to the floor with legs like jelly, but when you gain control B.J. decides to skip straight to being fully recovered, save for a couple blurry vision moments.

Crippling Overspecialization|"Carriers define this, that Wargaming points out themselves is a feature of the rough guideline for Tactical RockPaperScissors. Properly controlled and assigning squadrons properly can easily make the carrier and its flight squadrons the most dangerous unit on the battlefield as they can take on just about any ship type. However, its defense is severely lacking, and any enemy ship that spots it will have an XP and credit buffet to feast on. And poorly handling the squadrons can end up leaving the carrier with none to launch for the remainder of the battle, or worse yet, let the enemy follow a returning flight group right back to the carrier. American carriers suffer from an especially bad case of this. While IJN carriers also must make a choice between having more fighters or more bombers, the difference between the two load outs is no where near as extreme as in American carriers. Most Anti-ship American carriers don't have any fighters in their load outs and none of them have torpedo bombers in their anti-air squads. For the record, this has no historical basis. Japenese C Vs have a bad case of this after the 8.0.0 rework and subsequent hot fixes. While they are capable of attacking all ship types reasonably effectively, each of their planes basically counters one thing much better than the others. This can mean they can lose their flexibility if any one type is deplaned. Their attackers are arguably better than both American options using many high damage rockets, but they have bad penetration that limits their use to superstructure hits on non-destroyers. Their AP dive bombers are great against cruisers and sometimes battleships, but nearly useless against destroyers. Their torpedoes usually take to long to arm and aim for use against destroyers and often cruisers as well. Battleships as well. Despite having access to the strongest guns, and some of the longest ranges in game, they have large dispersion at those ranges, making it somewhat common to watch the shots from one bracket an enemy ship at long range, but not score any hits. At close ranges, their slow turret traverse speeds, and long reloading times can give destroyers that survive the first volley of main battery shots or aided by an ally distracting the battleship all the breathing room the destroyer needs to make an attempt to sail alongside, and unleash every single spread of torpedoes readied at the battleship. That said, what does get hit by a battleship's guns, will be hurting afterwards. Prior to the Open-Beta, the Japanese had a premium cruiser, the Kitakami, which had 20 torpedoes on each side, allowing for a Macross Missile Massacre when all 40 were sent off, but only 4 pop-guns for backup, and a slow reload on the torpedoes. It was removed when the game went to Open-Beta (though not completely, as Wargaming employees can still use it), and while no reason was given, this trope was cited by some. (Others being that it played too differently from other cruisers to be enjoyable, and that its 20-torpedo spreads made it a team-killing machine in the hands of careless players.) While no reason was given it's highly suspected to be related to the fact that, astoundingly, Kitakami server wide actually did more damage to teammates then the enemy. It was literally more dangerous to have on your team then it was the enemy's! Early Russian destroyers have terrible gunsnote typically inflicting pretty good damage for a destroyer but with turret rotation speed that would be slow even by battleship standards; it's often faster to put the ship through a 180 degree turn than to rotate the turrets and torpedoesnote often the torpedoes are fast and in some cases there are downright huge number of tubes, but with range so short it requires a suicidally close approach to hit the enemy but they can win races and run circles around the opposition with their insane speed and maneuverability. British cruisers have no high explosive shells, only armor piercing. While their AP is set with an unusually short fuse in order to avoid overpenetration against soft targets like destroyers, if a target is angled in such a way as to bounce the shots a British cruiser has to rely on hits to the superstructure - and given damage saturation mechanics, this is often not enough to destroy a ship completely. This is also bizarrely ahistorical, as the Royal Navy's ""armour piercing"" shell was actually a high-explosive shell given an armour-piercing cap, rather than a proper AP shell - the RN primarily used high explosive for its all-purpose ammunition. Most Japanese destroyers focus far more on torpedo armament and than they do on guns. This can give them unrivaled damage opportunities in the right situation but also makes them virtually useless in others. Asashio is the god king of this trope in the game. she has 20km 20k damage deep-water torpedoes. However, unlike the Pan-Asian deep-water torpedoes, Asashio's torps run under cruisers as well destroyers. Combined with her sub-par guns and her abysmal AA, Asashio is essentially only effective against Battleships, but is downright overpowered in this department.

Crippling Overspecialization|Quite a few builds suffer from this trope. As a general rule, even the most finely-tuned characters will have weak spots; as an example, full Psionic players have a great number of options for handling most enemies in the game, but few for handling robotic enemies. Robotic enemies resist most of the direct damage sources available to Psionics, are immune to most forms of crowd control, and No-Sell nearly all Thought Control abilities. Fortunately, the game gives you wiggle room to work around these issues with Bear Traps, Caltrops, Throwing Nets, and Grenades, which anyone can use, and which are universally effective. Special mention to the Cylcop's Eye. A unique set of goggles that booosts the damage dealt by the Plasma Beam psychic ability but limits you to a single psionic slot at a time.

Fully averted with the Holy Wand, which gives anyone the ability to cast Holy. Combined with Healing Magic Is the Hardest, this affects white mages hard. The hardest hit by Squishy Wizard are all healers, most have no physical attack to speak of, and most of them lack any damage-dealing skills or spells outside of abilities granted by espers (and Banish, which is fortunately the Trust Master reward for a very common friend-point summon unit).

Crippling Overspecialization|Power of 3, Power of 4, Power of 5, Cross Attack, L-Boost, and T-Boost are all skills that, while guaranteed to activate 100% of the time, require a very specific number or pattern of match to be made and are of no use in combos. They can become almost useless in situations where you have very few moves and are faced with a heavy amount of disruptions and non-supports.|Pokémon Shuffle|2015|VideoGame|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonShuffle
Crippling Overspecialization|While most players tend to favor one mood — Friendly, Devious, or Aggressive — and can take crew members, Treasure options, and research papers that grant bonuses for using that mood, specializing exclusively in one mood will hurt you when you run into enemies and encounters that punish that mood. You are supposed to assemble a crew of various classes, as every map contains challenges for all four classes. However, you are also permitted to assemble a crew entirely of one class, which makes it harder to pass challenges geared towards any other class. There are four separate achievements for beating the game with a crew like this (one for each class). There are three main campaign resources (Gold, Status and Research), while the game expects you to focus on one of them more than the other you still need some quantities of all three in order to build up your team.|Renowned Explorers|2015|VideoGame|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RenownedExplorers
Crippling Overspecialization|This can happen if you haven't chosen your weapons carefully enough.

Career-Ending Injury|It's generally a good idea to dismiss gravely injured troops and replace them with healthy raw recruits unless they're really experienced or you're just really attached to them. Your grizzled old Sister Superior with her peg-leg, gouged eye, mutilated hand and permanently crazed look on her face will certainly look like a badass even if her actual performance isn't so great. Skull fractures and severed arms and legs are what will most likely end your warriors' careers.|Mordheim: City of the Damned|2015|VideoGame|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MordheimCityOfTheDamned
An Arm and a Leg|Both are possible injuries. If a warrior is missing an arm, he'll never again wield an offhand weapon, a shield or a two-hander. A warrior with a missing foreleg becomes slower-moving and less capable of landing safely from a leap or jump. In both cases, the character completely loses the ability to climb. A small mercy is that your troops can still be Handicapped Badasses, and CPU enemies will have these too according to the state of your own troops.|Mordheim: City of the Damned|2015|VideoGame|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MordheimCityOfTheDamned
Crippling Overspecialization|Averted mostly by units with more than one weapon but still significant enough to be a rule of thumb. This rule can even apply to factions in terms of their unit rosters.

Crippling Overspecialization|MP-18, Trenchgun and semi-auto pistols are all great at close range... and not so at any other range.

Attention Deficit... Ooh, Shiny!|Assumed on the part of the audience, so the movie explains most of its concepts via on-screen text and cameos, including Australian actress Margot Robbie sipping champagne in a bubble bath. Justified in-universe: Jared Vennett: Mortgage-backed securities, subprime loans, tranches  its pretty confusing, right? Does it make you feel bored? Or stupid? Well, its supposed to.

Handicapped Badass|"The traits for generals and governors being sickly, or losing some vital body part are rough, but enough ranks could potentially let them get past that.

Disability Superpower|"Having a severed arm gives a warrior a +20% to their dodge rating. That's an even higher bonus then warriors who have two arms get for fighting in ordinary clothes with a one-handed weapon and nothing in their off-hand. It also makes sense for an appropriately-morbid reason - they have less body mass for their opponent to hit. For the Possessed hero, losing an arm is even more beneficial (especially if it's his left arm - his right arm is the only one capable of getting the extra-arm mutation). Normally the Possessed keeps getting tired and does reduced damage as he MUST use both his hands to attack, but losing his arm means that he can attack without these penalties and the extra dodge bonus is great for a hero that can only wear cloth. Similarly, a warrior with a missing eye will find it a bit harder to hit at both range and melee, but they do at least get a bonus to Perception checks. The ""Featureless Face"" mutation completely erases a character's eyes, nose and mouth, in exchange for making Perception checks completely free to perform, and with a +20% bonus. The Sisters of Sigmar Augur unit is blind, but is blessed with the sight of Sigmar, which basically gives her normal vision. On top of that, she's immune to eye injuries.

Arm Cannon|Jensen has a P.E.P.S. from the previous game mounted in his arm as well as a Nanoblade Launcher and a TESLA aug that lets him launch homing electric discharges. The many heavy mooks and police units wearing Powered Armor also have machineguns mounted on their left hand, that they can use to hose Jensen down with. Marchenko has a Frickin' Laser Cannon in his right arm. Even with fully-activated Rhino Dermal Armor, it's capable of tearing Jensen to shreds in less than three seconds.

It's revealed in the credits that after multiple surgeries he retained use of his left hand.

Doesn't matter if it's a Stun Lancer about to knock one of your troops unconscious, or a Viper about to bind and crush one of your troops. Put down a mimic beacon and watch as the aliens go to town on it. The only alien that doesn't attack the Mimic Beacon is the Faceless. The Mimic Beacon has a fixed 12 HP, meaning that in the early game levels, the Mimic Beacon could make the difference between winning and losing the game. Keep in mind that your soldiers in early levels have between 5-8 HP. It's even better with Mimic Beacons (plural), because you can easily get out of a spot by deploying one. For this reason, don't move the soldier with the Mimic Beacon until everyone else has taken their turn.|XCOM 2|2016|VideoGame|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOM2

Disruption of either these things will cause severe stress and anxiety, as shown when Christian could not complete his accounting job.  Neglecting to teach your autistic kid good social and emotional skills will lead to grave consequences down the road.

The one time he turns it to his advantage is when he shuts off the lights in the basement, and it's only his familiarity with his surroundings that enables him to get the advantage, not super-senses.

Crippling Overspecialization|Bladers who exhibit this get punished really hard. Zac and Rantaro focus purely on maintaining spin time without much variety aside from changing movement, thus they often get taken out by direct attacks. Xander's strategy in almost every series he's in is to brute force his way to victory; if that doesn't work he makes Xcalius lose two clicks to activate his Saber moves (which is why he usually loses to a Burst).

Crippling Overspecialization|Having more than one character of the same type is more often than not a waste of slot for badly needed versality in perks and access to specific dice. This is why the early game with Aleister Crowley is so painful  you start with not just one, but three cultists, while even one of them is one of the most useless companions. However, certain party members, like Animal Handler, Native Scout, or both versions of trader have their perks stack, which might be useful as long as you can work around the limited dice pool.|Curious Expedition|2016|VideoGame|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CuriousExpedition

Crippling Overspecialization|Generally, you want to keep your nichelings well-rounded. If you breed your nichelings for optimal strength, they'll get so slow it's impossible to get to the predators in time to protect their pack, not to mention they're far too costly to move around. However, if you forget to add any fighting ability whatsoever, you end up with your nicheling so defenseless it can't even kill rabbils when they come to steal your berries. You can end up with no fighting skills if your nicheling has: two nimble fingers/running legs, lean body/toxic body, and derp snout/big nose/venomous fangs. It's especially tragic if you spent time breeding the venomous fangs; since they don't add any fighting ability on their own, you have no way to attack and poison the predators. Fixed after the 0.2 update, venomous fangs now gives 1 strength in addition to venom.|Niche|2016|VideoGame|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Niche

Crippling Overspecialization|Pike infantry is extremely effective when in formation, due to every unit essentially being able to attack over their shoulders - but if they're hit from behind or scattered by a charge, suddenly those pikes can't hit much at close range.

Crippling Overspecialization|Invoked. Haku gets Munechika to provide training to him under the excuse that he relies too much on his mask and needs to learn to fight without it. Two problems with this. One, Oshtor was known to be a master of all weapons apart from the bow and to be unmatched at unarmed combat as well. Two, throughout the game Haku is obviously relying heavily on his mask. Still, Munechika doesn't really know Oshtor nearly as well as Mikazuchi or some others so the excuse works.|Utawarerumono: Mask of Truth|2016|VideoGame|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UtawarerumonoMaskOfTruth

Crippling Overspecialization|The Last Bodybuilder has an absolutely insane strength score (106, when the normal max is 6, or 13 with very particular traits and perks), letting him pick up and throw nearly anything in the game, including cars and heavy machinery. Unfortunately, this is his only method of attack, as he only has one inventory slot, and can't even swing or shoot actual weapons. He can use thrown items, but such items are rare and generally weak. The T*S*T*C* (Too Swole To Control) perk lets characters start with a high strength, and can train it even higher than other characters can achieve. The description states that the character refuses to do cardio, so fitness is capped at 2. They can swing heavy weapons and pick up furniture, but still will get tired quickly. Horse is the fastest human character in the game. Similar to TLB, he also only has one inventory spot, and can't use melee weapons. He can shoot, but will go nuts with any gun he's given, draining your ammo in moments.|Death Road to Canada|2016|VideoGame|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeathRoadToCanada

Crippling Overspecialization|In contrast to Battlefield 4 and Battlefield Hardline, classes are now less flexible outside of their intended ranges. The Assault class dominate in close quarters thanks to its submachine guns (highest DPS) and shotguns. However, it struggles to harm anyone outside of 50 meters as its weapons have horrible accuracy and recoil at range. The Medic class excels in mid-range, especially after their weapons received a damage buff in January 2018 patch. However, they can't outgun Assault players in close quarters or Scout players at range. The Support class can mow down waves of players with pinpoint accuracy, but only if aiming down and either lying down or mounted on a wall. Like Medics, they usually operate best a mid-range where they can set themselves up to mow down enemy players through sheer volume of fire. The Scout class, in tradition to its equivalent classes from previous games, operates most effectively from range with its bolt action rifles, which fire slowly but deal massive damage. The sweet-spot mechanic gives the majority of its rifles the means to have a medium-long effective range depending on the weapon chosen, instantly kill infantry if the Scout works at their preferred range. However, even the Infantry-variants of their rifles are no match to an Assault up close and can be outgunned by a Medic if theyre not a crack shot or are in their sweet-spot range.|Battlefield 1|2016|VideoGame|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield1

Glass Eye|Vigo has one in a bunsen burner filled with water to keep it sterilized. One of the first puzzles in the game is to find a lighter or match so that he can light the burner. In Chapter 2, Leonard finds a similar boiling glass eye on the island, and can potentially send a text message to his students warning them to beware of someone with a glass eye; this lets Rooney know in Chapter 3 not to trust Vigo. On the path to the best ending, Rooney replaces one of her own eyes with the spare; it turns out to be somehow related to the ritual that created the Scissorwalker.|Nightcry|2016|VideoGame|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Nightcry

Kruger uses Reflection nanites to keep her disease in check, though she still becomes very ill when in areas with polluted air. Even after Faith shuts down Reflection and causes Isabel's disease to kick back in at full force, she is still able to put up a hell of a fight. Another moment reflecting her fighting skill happens earlier in the game  during the mission where you help Black November kidnap her. Over the radio, Rebecca tells them to take out her squad first and then subdue Isabel. She later barks ""I said subdue her!"" at her subordinates, implying Isabel was giving them trouble. One girl, and all those  Black November members are having trouble taking her down. This after they seemingly had no trouble taking out her squad.

Crippling Overspecialization|The British and Commonwealth anti-tank field guns (and the American 57mm AT field gun) have no high-explosive shells available, making them reliant on friendly units for anti-infantry support. Compare this to the Axis' equivalent guns, which often have at least some high-explosive shells at their disposal. Averted by the American 75mm anti-tank field gun and all the Allied tank destroyers and self-propelled anti-tank guns, which do carry HE shells (and almost all of the self-propelled anti-tank guns also have at least one machine gun). Despite all of the Commonwealth anti-tank field guns falling under this, their 25-pounder howitzer, both in field gun form and in Sexton form, avert this, having both HE shells and AT shells, and their AT shells are actually fairly effective, having a higher armour penetration than the average Sherman or light anti-tank gun. Most of the infantry sections that specialise in close range fighting, like the Canadian Stormtroopers, the 1st SSB Commando Assault teams, and the German Strosstrup and SS-Strosstrup. Almost all of them are armed with nothing but submachine guns, smoke grenades, and satchel charges, which have the lowest possible range of any weapon in the game, meaning they need to be micromanaged to get close to any foe without being pinned down and wiped out. To make matters worse, almost all of them are smaller than your average infantry squad, making them easier to wipe out. The Strosstrup have it the worst. While the SS-Strosstrup have the Panzerfaust for anti-tank defence, and the satchel charges carried by the Allied sections are powerful enough to knock out or even destroy light and medium tanks at close range, the Strosstrup only have submachine guns and smoke grenades. If they meet a vehicle with any sort of armour, and they don't have outside support, they have to run for it, regardless of range. Most of the two or three man scout teams. Almost always armed with just submachine guns, and with only two members, they will get wiped out if they run into anything but another two man team. A few do avert this, like the Ranger Marauders, who carry a bazooka and as such make a decent anti-tank team, or the Canadian Sniper Scouts, the British Airborne Sniper, and the French SAS Sniper, who are highly effective against infantry and field guns if used properly.|Steel Division: Normandy 44|2017|VideoGame|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SteelDivisionNormandy44

The Grizzco Slosher in particular is fantastic at destroying bosses, and can even eliminate ones that normally can't be defeated by simply firing at them (such as Flyfish and Steelheads), but has a really hard time against almost anything else due to its slow rate of fire, slow shots, and an ink consumption of 25% per shot.|Splatoon 2|2017|VideoGame|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon2

Firefighter is equipped well enough to easily beat missions with the aforementioned kind of zombies, but everywhere else his mediocre attack and movement speed make him very underwhelming, to the point he is entirely irrelevant past location 6. Ironically, there also exists an item set called ""Firefighter"", and it too suffers from overspecialization. All it does is increase the unit's fire damage by 30%.

Crippling Overspecialization|"Archers can destroy flying enemies, even stage bosses, in one or two shots, but are soft-countered by anything with a defense score worth writing home about (that is, pretty much everything except mages). ""Slayer"" Weapons, which are designed to specifically target a certain class of enemy (such as heavy armor, dragons and mounted units), are typically weaker than other weapons of their class, and forging these qualities on other weapons in turn will make them weaker. Exemptions come when those attributes are locked to the weapon, such as the three Falchions, which are most deadly against dragons but are still effective against other enemy types, and if the player has unlocked the True Power and Divine Favor weapon attributes on any given unit's personal weapon, which negates the weaker damage penalty from foreign Slaying attributes."|Fire Emblem Warriors|2017|VideoGame|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemWarriors

There are also other autistic people living in the home, with distinct differences to further emphasise the variations that can happen with the condition. And rather than being stereotypically obsessed with math and science, Wendy is a Star Trek nerd; acknowledging the significant neurodivergent fan base the franchise has. There's also the fact that Wendy is only in the home because Audrey is ignorant of how to properly care for her, when their mother had been able to previously.|Please Stand By|2017|Film|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PleaseStandBy

Ellen Leigh herself may have channeled Paimon and was medically interpreted as a system with DID because Paimon's personality fully took over hers occasionally. Charles Leigh was paranoid because he was groomed as a vessel for Paimon and was literally threatened by people being put into him, and Charlie was displaced by Paimon's spirit since her birth, explaining her withdrawn and macabre behavior."|Hereditary|2018|Film|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hereditary

While the accuracy advantage over the two other development tracks in each category is appreciable in the early game, where all of your classes are low-leveled and don't have good aim, these same units will have improved enough at Elite and Paragon levels that they could start compensating for the lower Aim of the other weapon systems without having to sacrifice shot damage or magazine capacity, both of which can be crucial during later chapters.|Valkyria Chronicles 4|2018|VideoGame|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyriaChronicles4
Crippling Overspecialization|Some pawns are geared so tightly to one job that putting them to work elsewhere is somewhere between foolish and detrimental to the colony. That said, what they can do, they do really well. Pikeman mechanoids are dangerous at long ranges but completely helpless in melee combat. With Biotech installed, the various humanoid xenotypes all specialize in something while being bad at almost everything else, and although their shortcomings can be overcome through sufficient training and perseverance, it's usually not worth the effort. However, if you happen to need someone for a particular niche, they'll outperform baseliner pawns nine times out of ten. Neanderthals are dumb brutes good only for manual labor and smashing things in close combat. Impids are Fragile Speedsters geared around fire and heat tolerance that hit a literal brick wall if they have to go up against anything that isn't flammable, or find themselves in colder climates. Hussars are excellent soldiers with high combat skills and an insane Healing Factor. They're also genetically dependent on Go-Juice, making them pretty much unemployable in any colony that forbids the use of hard drugs, and their sole focus on combat often makes them subpar laborers as well. Highmates are genetically engineered sex slaves. They're ridiculously fragile, mentally incapable of violence, and often useless in terms of doing any work other than providing one of your pawns with eternal companionship. Dirtmoles are like stereotypical dwarves - they like digging underground, dislike light and open spaces, and are crap at ranged combat, making them useful only as night shift miners or if you're running an undergrounder colony already. Genies are great researchers and craftsmen with fragile bodies and No Social Skills. Wasters are a bit of an oddity in this list for having a genetic dependency on hard drugs similar to Hussars, but without any noteworthy lack in other skills. If your drug policy can accommodate them, they're essentially baseliners with the bonus of being immune to toxic environments.

Crippling Overspecialization|Specializing 'Mechs in one weapon type has numerous advantages and just as many drawbacks. Energy-focused 'Mechs can be very powerful but often end up crippled in hot biomes due to their excessive heat generation. Ballistic 'Mechs deal tons of damage with little heat buildup but are at risk of running out of ammo in prolonged battles, plus their explosive ammo bins make them much more susceptible to incoming hits. Both also fare poorly on hilly or urban maps where it can be hard to get decent sight lines on the enemy. Missile boats don't have this problem, but their lack of precision targeting makes it difficult to bring down hostile 'Mechs quickly and efficiently, and trying to do so with headshots is all but impossible. All of this is less of a problem if you build your lance so that your specialists cover each others' weaknesses.|BattleTech (2018)|2018|VideoGame|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattleTech2018
Crippling Overspecialization|The Erusean military, on their drones in general but the Arsenal Birds in particular. The drones represent a fast, precise, and cheap counter to the vastly more powerful allied forces, consisting of the Osean Air Defense Force (and their naval counterparts) and their IUN allies (consisting of most of the nations that formally comprised ISAF, who by themselves were able to beat Erusea in a war). The Arsenal Birds have an argument as the most indestructible superweapon yet created in Strangereal, with their massive drone swarms, Macross Missile Massacre capabilities, and nearly-impenetrable defensive shields (and, ironically, they're stolen from Osea). Having both on air superiority duties lets Erusea occupy most of Usea. However, once Osea and the IUN manage to shoot one down with Stonehenge, Erusea has to shrink the defensive envelope of the remaining one, and Osea and the IUN manage to liberate most of Erusea's occupied territory... in a single off-hand mention in a briefing. Some planes and special weapons are massively specialized for a single mission profile, to the detriment of pretty much everything else. The A-10C is an excellent ground attack plane with a very low stall speed, huge reserve of machine gun ammo, and vast reserves of any of its three air-to-ground SP weapons (4AGM, UGB, and RKT), but it's in a game with maybe one pure ground attack mission, and its poor agility and speed make it probably the worst dogfighting plane in the game, especially when it can only engage other planes with its machine gun and standard missiles. The F-15J is entirely specialized the other way—it's the only plane with only guided air-to-air SP weapons (SAAM, HCAA, QAAM), leaving it in a rough spot in ground attack scenarios (especially against hard targets like ships). The F-104C's GRKT is probably the single most specialized weapon in the game. It fires several rockets all at one target, doing tremendous damage and easily overwhelming defenses like CIWS. However, such targets are rare, and its long cooldown makes it hard to use to in most situations. It's unmatched against ships, but in the regular campaign, that's only really relevant in two missions and it's not very useful against the much more common tanks and SAMs and AA guns.

Bury Your Disabled|"The Artist in ""Meal Ticket"" is drowned in a river. The death happens offscreen, so the audience can only imagine what it was like. Previous scenes go out of their way to emphasize how dependent the Artist is on the Impresario physically — but also how the Impresario has no talent or apparent skills himself, making him equally dependent on the Artist... until the very moment he thinks he has a working replacement. Alice's brother in ""The Gal Who Got Rattled"" is shown walking in a way that suggests he may have rickets, however it appears to have no bearing whatsoever on the story; any difficulty he has walking is completely incidental to his death by cholera, and his whole characterisation is based on him being a mean-spirited, useless failure."|The Ballad of Buster Scruggs|2018|Film|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBalladOfBusterScruggs

Mental Health Recovery Arc|At first, Dr. Forrester thinks he has just another - if unusual - patient. Aside from the supernatural/horror aspects, the movie portrays this trope with surprising, sobering realism. John Doe is sent to the emergency psych ward because the hospital doctors don't know what to do with him. And even then, he's no shape to fill out the consent forms. Dr. Forrester secretly - and illegally - admits him into the ward, because he knows John Doe would probably get left to rot in the streets otherwise. And even then, John Doe can't legally be put under involuntary hold for more than 72 hours, and Dr. Forrester resorts to hypnosis to quickly figure out what's wrong with him. There often aren't enough medical staff on hand, so sometimes patients go unsupervised, with tragic results. While John Doe eventually remembers things,  it's really the demon imitating or giving him enough clarity to be released. The scene of  his panicking father coming to pick him up after thinking John had died is exactly how these situations can play out.|The Dead Center|2019|Film|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDeadCenter

Crippling Overspecialization|Bayonet builds are often guilty of this. Like caster setups, these demand a lot of Ichor to fuel their main method of attack, and hit hard when they actually land shots. To this end, they focus on getting the most Willpower and Mind possible, so as to attain a high Ichor count. Once this Ichor stock is depleted, though, they're essentially sitting ducks with very few means of getting it back, as Bayonets naturally suck at draining, so they don't even have that going for them unlike mage builds who at least could use light swords with Devour to recoup their spent Mana. Additionally, running a dedicated Bayonet build means both of your weapons should ideally be these, thus leaving no room for blades and such, and your Blood Veil should be light and therefore low on Defense and Endurance, so if a monster gets sufficiently close to you, or you are ambushed by the enemy, or both, you're pretty much SOL, since despite the name, Bayonets aren't very good up close.

His laughter at inappropriate times turns out to be the result of a twisted sense of humor, not a mental illness, and his ""hallucinations"" turn out to merely be daydreams and fantasies that the audience is led to believe are real, though Arthur himself never shows any evidence of truly believing these fantasies are real."|Joker|2019|Film|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Joker2019

Dwarfism and Gigantism have affects on appearance beyond just height and reflect other common physical traits of people with those conditions. Even a clubfoot or a peg-leg, which isn't normally shown on the portrait slightly alters how the character stands to reflect the deformity or disability. However, one physical deformity remains an Informed Attribute - a hunchback. Characters with the Hunchback trait have no alterations to their portrait relative to those who don't have it.

Crippling Overspecialization|Many clan bonuses fall into this, such as the Sanada Clan providing buffs only if you have a Cross Spear equipped. Chosokabe Motochika's armor, Tosa Governor, has the Singular Mastery effect, which provides high skill damage increase if the user has only one skill set to any of their stances. Later on, Graces will provide much larger damage bonuses without being nearly as restricting. It would explain why Motochika only uses Twisting Spear. Izanami's Grace offers higher bonuses with its common effects than any other Ethereal Grace, with the condition that the user must be within the Dark Realm. Futsunushi's Grace specializes in Sheathed Active Skills. There are a total of eight such skills, half of which belong to Sword. This is only a marginally wider net than the original game's version of the set which applied only to Iai Quickdraw.

Crippling Overspecialization|Maverick is subject to this, although it's clearly by choice. He's probably the best fighter pilot in the world, but being a fighter pilot is all he wants to be. It does impact his naval career. He's a Navy Captain, equivalent to an Air Force or Army full colonel. He's not serving in a position befitting his rank. A Navy Captain would be commanding ships, submarines, Air Wings, or entire bases, not serving as an instructor pilot. Maverick is, however, perfectly happy with that, knowing he doesn't have the administrative, personnel, or political skills to really succeed or be satisfied in any of those positions. It's made clear several times that his being close friends with Iceman, who has risen to be one of the top admirals in the Navy, has allowed him to stay in the cockpit. Iceman probably has been looking out for Maverick ever since they met, knowing Mitchell is ill-suited for anything other than being a fighter pilot.|Top Gun: Maverick|2020|Film|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TopGunMaverick

Dismemberment Is Cheap|Losing a limb means absolutely nothing in the City, since they are easy to replace for its technology standards. An entity who suffered from an otherwise extreme injury in real life such as losing an eye or a whole limb can get a new one back for a cheap price, at least cheaper than firearms. In fact, often you have to deliberately get your body parts cut off and replace them with a prosthetic body part, and almost every combatant in the city had at least one of their body parts replaced, or the tattoos on their body aren't just for show. Some entities such as the Brotherhood of Iron or the Gaze Office even resemble cyborgs than someone who had their body parts replaced. It's justified too considering how most of the City's residents rely on jobs that require bloodshed for income, indicating that severe injuries are all but the inevitable. Getting body replacements not only increase the user's strength but also ensures otherwise crippling injuries can be easily mitigated. Within the Library itself, this is taken up to eleven as lost limbs and other lethal wounds can be repaired in a snap without any sign of injury. This fact is forgotten once they enter battle, however, for various reasons.|Library of Ruina|2020|VideoGame|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LibraryOfRuina

Disability Immunity|Both Shionne and Alphen suffer from body conditions that prove complementary to each other as an effective team. Alphen's inability to feel pain allows him to interact with Shionne despite her Curse Of Thorns making the mere act of touching her incredibly painful, and that same inability to process pain allowing him to wield the Blazing Sword Shionne creates (something she herself expresses frustration that she's incapable of doing, despite its immense power being beneficial to her goals), while Shionne's Healing Hands allow her to fix Alphen back up afterwards to ensure the damage the sword does to him isn't permanent.

Crippling Overspecialization|Downplayed with the Paladin's Oath of Tirmar sub-class. By using your Scourge of the Hidden power, you can deal major damage to everything that shapeshifts and/or sees in the dark. And that's it. But nearly all beasts, as well as quite a few other creatures in the base game have Darkvision, so you'll get a significant mileage from the ability regardless. Shapeshifters are much less common, but the Sorr-Akath, main antagonists of the Crown of the Magister campaign, have both Darkvision and shapeshifting, making them take the bonus damage twice.|Solasta: Crown of the Magister|2021|VideoGame|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SolastaCrownOfTheMagister
Crippling Overspecialization|Using the auto level feature will tend to create a party which is heavy on healers, archers, and dual-wielders, discouraging tanky defensive playstyles in favor of charging in and piling on damage while heavily buffed. A few companions also come pre-specialized in extremely exotic weapon types. Surprisingly, Regill's specialization in the gnomish hooked hammer Double Weapon is well-provided for with several strategic drops, despite normally being very uncommon. Greybor gets hit hard, however, with dwarven waraxes being rare, and Woljif's favored magic daggers are unusually sparse compared to Kingmaker. This can mean you're faced with the choice of either having the companion run around with an inferior weapon that fits their specialization or losing access to the specialization benefits but giving them a more up-to-snuff weapon which wastes their feat choices.|Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous|2021|VideoGame|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PathfinderWrathOfTheRighteous

Crippling Overspecialization|Most students are fairly useful in most content of the game, but some of the students are extremely specialized for certain enemies: Chihiro's skills are particularly tailored for only a single gamemode  Hod Total Assault. Her EX Skill, while being quite cheap, is completely useless under most circumstances: its cast time is really long, damage is underwhelming and only a single target is affected by it, and it's long stunning perk affects only Heavy (aka Yellow) armored targets. Hod, on its own, has Heavy Armor (and its summoned erosion towers also have Heavy Armor), is one of the few raid bosses that is actually taking any effect from Crowd Control (if Crowd Control duration hits the limit, Hod or Erosion Towers take 300% more damage), making Chihiro the most useful student against this particular boss. Shizuko and Shimiko are the only students that can deploy cover in the battlefield. Its usefulness is questionable, as the cover is immobile, and the block rate under the cover is RNG-reliant (not only by simple blocking chance, but also the fact that someone else might go under the deployed cover), leaving you to choose specific students with good mood (primary factor for block rate) or wasting 3 cost for deploying the cover for no survivability boost. On Total Assault boss Shiro and Kuro, both students are exceptionally good at dealing with Shiro's large rolling bombs on the lane, as the rolling bomb will deal significantly less damage to obstacles (such as covers), and if the rolling bomb cannot crush the obstacle, it will bounce back at Shiro, increasing its Groggy Gauge while saving the team from getting heavily damaged. Against Kuro, both students can deploy obstacles on the way to block the massive incoming damage inflicted from theme park rides.

An Arm and a Leg|Clank loses his right arm when the dimensionator explodes and he is separated from Ratchet. When he meets Rivet upon waking up, he's still missing it.  Clank actually goes through the whole game missing the arm, though his playable segments have it attached, due to being mental projections. When getting the Fixers aid, Clank comes to terms with losing his limb, claiming to it that he is 'fixed' in spite of his incomplete state, to get the depressed robot out of his nihilistic funk. Don't worry, he gets a new one during the credits sequence, courtesy of Rivet. It's even yellow like her own right arm! A plot point is Rivet's own robotic right arm. She got the arm, and her distrust of robots, from being surprised and attacked by one of Emperor Nefarious' warbots when trying to sneak into his tower, having to replace her damaged limb when she was able to unexpectedly flee once the robot stopped attacking. Unbeknownst to Rivet, said warbot was actually Kit, her dimension's 'Clank', who was merely trying to non-lethally subdue Rivet, but whose weaponry and programming overrode her intentions and led to Kit accidentally blasting Rivet full-force. Kit's horror at having dangerously wounded Rivet allowed the lombax to flee. Finding out and overcoming their negative emotions towards each other for the act serves as a significant hurdle for Rivet and Kit to overcome. A plot point is Rivet's own robotic right arm.

Handicapped Badass|In addition to losing his right arm, the Dimensionator explosion also appears to have left Clank 'stuck' in his backpack mode, unable to extend his legs and move under his own power, being largely dependant on either Rivet or Ratchet to transport him around.  This comes into play with the Phase Quartz retrieval, as Rivet is forced to let the crystal get smashed because the drill's laser was about to hit both it and Clank, and he couldn't move out of the way on his own. This does not stop him from helping out as best as he can with his limitations, being the brains and main coordinator behind their plan to rebuild the Dimensionator, and resolving Dimensional Anomalies to help his partners progress, being playable as a mental projection of himself.  He also helps out in the final battle, ringing the Pirate Bell to summon Bubbles, the kraken, through a portal Ratchet summons to attack Emperor Nefarious.|Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart|2021|VideoGame|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClankRiftApart

Crippling Overspecialization|The Big Swig Roller is designed to be a painting specialist weapon, sporting a horizontal flick that covers a massive area, a long-range vertical flick, and a wide roll mode that barely uses ink. This comes at a severe cost of kill potential; it's the only Roller weapon in the game that is incapable of One-Hit Splatting with horizontal flicks, and its vertical flick can only instantly splat at point-blank range. The Splattershot Nova struggles with this as well. Like the Big Swig, it's designed to be a painting weapon, with very good ink efficiency, long range, and painting capability, but having a 5-shot kill relegates it to doing nothing but paint, in the same vein as the Aerospray line.

An Arm and a Leg|E.G. Mine gets his arms swiftly cut off by Knives for his failure to capture Jeneora Rock's Plant. Father Nebraska immediately follows, losing his arm when he tries to kill Knives, and one of the townspeople loses hers so Knives can drag her to her death soon afterwards. Vash likewise gained his prosthetic arm by way of his brother's blades, albeit in his case, it was due to his incomplete and uncontrollable activation of his Gate, manifesting as a black hole-like sphere centered over his left forearm that sucked in everything around it. It's made clear that if Knives hadn't cut if off to allow the arm alone to be destroyed, Vash would have been killed by a power that he didn't understand, a very different context from the same event in the manga.

By the time of the final fight with him, he creates as full-on replacement arm out of materialized Force to more easily dual wield his twin sabers against Cal, though there's also an element of Mind Screw involved. With his full power, even Cal working together with Bode prove no match for Dagan in a fight, and is forced to target his unresolved mental trauma to pull off a narrow victory.|Star Wars Jedi: Survivor|2023|VideoGame|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsJediSurvivor

Crippling Overspecialization|"Played straight in Advance, averted in Battalion. Of particular note is the Missile unit from the Nintendo/Advance series, which is not only ludicrously specialized but also almost completely useless at what it does. note Missiles are an anti-air indirect unit whose range is shorter than the movement of every air unit save the T Copter, which can still dodge in under their Arbitrary Weapon Range. B Copters can swoop in and nail them with no trouble, while Bombers and Fighters can practically dance around them. To serve their intended role, they require bait and usually must work in pairs, while an equivalent cost of Anti-Airs would be vastly more useful. Blockading airports is another viable option, as a full health Missile can take out any air units that gets deployed. Their +1 boost to range and movement in Days of Ruin served to take them from ""worthless"" to ""ludicrously situational"". Then there are the Piperunners. They absolutely cannot move if there are no pipes to move around, and the enemy would just stay out of their range anyway.
