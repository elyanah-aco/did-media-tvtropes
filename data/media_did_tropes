The Killer in Me|The film somehow manages to do both. Rowena's initially presented as a reporter who's investigating the murder of Grace, with the most likely culprit being Harrison. However, it's revealed that she was Grace's killer—having done her in to end years of blackmailing before she successfully pins the blame on the innocent if slimy-looking businessman. Oh, and she resorts to murder again when Miles tries to blackmail her about setting Harrison up. All this would look like the Secretive Killer type... except that she's surprised several times by developments she should've already known, which would make her seem to be the Amnesiac Killer type. This is allegedly because the twist of Rowena being Grace's killer is the result of a last-minute change of the film's ending.|Perfect Stranger|2007|Film|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PerfectStranger

The Killer in Me|It turns out Jim, who's the closest thing to a single protagonist, is the mystery killer.

Shadow Archetype|Goeth to Schindler. The Central Theme of the movie is about the value of life; Goeth's casual and uncaring manner of killing people is contrasted with Schindler's pretending to be equally uncaring in order to wrap them up in his protection. By the end, despite saving over a thousand people, he breaks down in tears over not being able to save more. On the other hand, Goeth goes to his death unrepentant and utterly unmoved.|Schindler's List|1993|Film|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SchindlersList
Shadow Archetype|Bo Catlett loves movies as much as Chili does and can be quite affable, but he's a lot more ostentatious and much more ready to use violence. Also, both have mixed ethnic ancestry. Chili is half-Italian, half-Hispanic, which prevented him from being a bonafide mobster; Catlett is half-black, half-Native American and also experienced prejudice as a child (worse prejudice which explains his much more violent behavior).|Get Shorty|1995|Film|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GetShorty

With Charlie finally giving into his primal side, Hank's identity began to fade away until there was nothing left but Charlie.|Me, Myself & Irene|2000|Film|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MeMyselfAndIrene
Shadow Archetype|Perpetua and Bridget. Bridget loathes Perpetua, resenting her for being bossy because she is slightly senior to Bridget at work and is also envious of Perpetua's own self-assurance that she is desirable and competent. One example is the launch party where Bridget tries to glam up and appear to be poised, but doesn't feel like she belongs and lacks the confidence to ease into conversations with the literati, while Perpetua strides in, back straight, demanding that someone introduce her to someone in a conversation. Perpetua is also naturally more assertive than Bridget and has a special disdain for Daniel Cleaver and she is liked more by posh snobs like Mark and Natasha.|Bridget Jones' Diary|2001|Film|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BridgetJonesDiary
Shadow Archetype|Nick to Danny. Both pull assorted scams and are perceived as bad influences to younger relatives, but Danny sees his hustling antics as harmless fun and genuinely wants to save Christmas. Nick (while having some standards deep down) engages in outright criminal activity and makes things worse while trying to enrich himself. John is openly worried about Danny ending up like Nick, to the point of not wanting them alone unsupervised. Even Santa (despite having put Danny on the naughty list) notes there's still a big difference between nephew and uncle.Santa: I mean, Danny... why-why, he's a little naughty from time to time, but Nick Wrigly is incorrigible! John represents what Peter could become. Both are little brothers, but whereas Peter continually idolizes Danny no matter what, John has long since given up seeing any good in Nick. Nick's lifetime of performing scams has made John not want anything to do with him if he can help it.|'Twas the Night|2001|Film|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwasTheNight

Shadow Archetype|Regina and Janis for each other. Regina is manipulative, two-faced, and cunning, but maintains an outwardly friendly and affable demeanor. Janis, on the other hand, is apparently less attractive than Regina and claims not to care about any of that and poses as being above all Regina's petty high school business. However, Regina's high school manipulations and plotting is also reflected in Janis's plot for revenge. Regina, like Janis, has a lot of anger that she refuses to acknowledge, while Janis is relatively comfortable with her own anger and bitterness.|Mean Girls|2004|Film|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MeanGirls

Both love their daughters who are technically the same person, and both (to varying degrees unwittingly) brought them to the cult, but where Dahlia was weaker and only managed to fetch the police too late, Rose personally fights to save her daughter before they can burn her alive,even if it means helping Alessa's dark side to kill the cultists.|Silent Hill|2006|Film|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SilentHill

Shadow Archetype|James for Joe. Both are extremely violent men but, while Joe kills his beloved dog, he is shown to try and avoid taking it out on people, preferring to hammer his shed down. He also mocked his wife for her weight, but still loved her, feels a great deal of remorse, and misses her desperately.

Shadow Archetype|Ms Hussa is one to both Wadjda and her mother. To Wadjda. Ms. Hussa reveals that she can relate to Wadjda rebelliousness, and indeed the headmistress does not really follow the rules she enforces on her pupils (she has a career of her own, she isn't married and has a secret lover). You get the feeling that somehow she must have decided to follow the flow to satisfy her ambitions, and indeed Wadjda herself pretends to conform to the rules for her agenda (buying the forbidden bicycle). To Mother. They are both conventionally beautiful, glamorous women who are also extremely religious and very strict parental figures to Wadjda. However, Ms. Hussa is an Hypocrite, while Mother can be misguided and bigoted but definitely has Wadjda's best interests in her heart. To Mother.

Shadow Archetype|"Arguably, Juliet is this to Sam.  Both of them were bullied by Lindsay in the past, but whereas Juliet starts out as her best friend and could even qualify as a Fallen Princess, Sam and Lindsay become friends just before high-school. Sam becomes one of Lindsay's Alpha Bitch followers, ditching her old hobbies to fit in, whereas Juliet becomes an extremely unpopular loner because of Lindsay's bullying. The fact that Juliet is the key to Sam breaking out of her ""Groundhog Day"" Loop is possibly a reflection of this."|Before I Fall|2017|Film|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BeforeIFall
Shadow Archetype|Halley to Ashley. Both are rebellious single mothers living in a run-down, crappy motel, but there are key differences between the two. While Halley is unable to keep a job, often has to do shady things in order to pay the rent, lets Moonee do whatever she wants (which often has horrible results) and throws profane tantrums when something doesn't go her way, Ashley has an actual job at a diner, actually tries to parent Scooty, and is more mature in her relationships.|The Florida Project|2017|Film|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFloridaProject

Shadow Archetype|"Many, if not all, Bond villains represent the worst aspects of 007. Skyfall: Raoul Silva is a former MI6 agent (and a brilliant one, according to M), who is what Bond could easily become if he didn't forgive or trust M for the things she puts him through. Silva even points this out multiple times over the course of the film, and the other characters aren't arguing with him, especially given that M leaving Silva for dead in China has echoes of her risking Bond's life at the beginning of the movie. Silva going rogue also harkens back to Alec Trevelyan, another ex-MI6 agent who had a similar grudge against his former employer.Silva: We are the last two rats. Other examples from the films include Die Another Day's Gustav Graves/Colonel Moon, From Russia with Love's Red Grant, Casino Royale's Le Chiffre (suave, handsome men of action), and A View to a Kill's Max Zorin. The titular villains of Dr. No and The Man with the Golden Gun also attempt, less convincingly, to play Shadow Archetypes to Bond. They all easily serve to remind Bond of what he could be without his moral compass and if he allowed his feelings to control his life. Some of them even freely admit being cold-blooded villains, invoke the ""Not So Different"" Remark on 007, and harbor no loyalty to others, including whomever's sponsoring them (KGB, Red China, etc.) but themselves. GoldenEye: 006/Alec Trevelyan, Bond's former partner, who reappears from the dead and continually taunts 007 about his loyalty to England and Idiot Hero tendencies to lose allies and women during missions. Despite sharing many of Bond's qualities, Alec's personality shows the dangers of being stuck in the past with old grudges, as he claims a hatred for England for their (perceived) past transgressions. Ernst Stavro Blofeld, 007's Arch-Enemy and head of the Nebulous Evil Organization SPECTRE, is a stark contrast to M. While both head a secret organization and give orders directly to their subordinates, M commands the respect of his peers and subordinates, but Blofeld would often kill minions just for minor reasons. Blofeld also serves as a warped mirror image of Bond, especially in terms of lethality, wit, and shrewdness. The way they rose is also a stark difference: whereas Bond is of Blue Blood (albeit a minor one) yet puts his life on the line to stop power-hungry terrorists and criminal nutjobs, Blofeld is of modest origins but rose to power by questionable means and is willing to hold the entire world at gunpoint if he doesn't get what he wants. To drive this even further, the Mirrored Confrontation Shot between the two during Spectre's climax even shows the visual similarities they share, albeit with Blofeld being a mutilated and monstrous Bond. M gets another Shadow Archetype in the form of C/Max Denbigh in Spectre, the new head of the Joint Intelligence Service. Whereas M is an ex-spy like Bond, is capable of handling firearms and has shown genuine concern for his subordinates, C serves as an Obstructive Bureaucrat who mocks M's insistence on stopping C from scrapping the 00-agent agent in favour of Attack Drones and Big Brother Is Watching, and hurls childish insults whenever someone inquires about the surveillance program he favours. It's later revealed that C is in cahoots with Blofeld, and is willing to sell out England for more political power unlike M, who remains loyal to queen and country. When C tries to have Bond and M killed for interfering in his Evil Plan, he didn't realize M's more hands-on field approach enabled him to sweep the room and empty Denbigh's gun before he got there.

Hyde Plays Jekyll|"After various updates, Saiko's Yangire mode is capable of pretending she's in her (somewhat friendlier) Yandere State, usually to try and get you to unlock a door keeping her out or to accept a potion she's tainted in some way. Once you do, she reverts right back (and her eyes start glowing again) while she happily mocks you for doing something that stupid. Considering she's perfectly capable of busting down any locked door or just catching you if she's close enough to offer a potion, she doesn't even need to do this and it's clearly her just fucking with you more. The entire basis of Yandere Mode. She's not actually helping you there, she's just setting you up to get drugged... so she can cut your character's head off when the sun goes down. She can also fake being her yandere side for when you give her the diary, during which she will stay close to Akira and offer to give him the code, actually giving him a few of the numbers before revealing her ruse and saying ""Kill"" while laughing before she tries to kill him again.

Right when the war was about to end with a peace accord, she blew up a Wo K Lanian space station. To salvage the peace, she was tried and sentenced to a Death of Personality via the neuromod, with the file of her original personality surrendered to the Wo K Lanians as a goodwill offering. Fellow veteran and old flame James Gordon knows all of this, and was asked to keep an eye on her. However, Gloria was perceptive enough to realize that not all the pieces of her new idenity lined up, and hired private investigators to learn that the neuromod rotates owners and, for the duration of the cruise, was in the possession of General Thul. When she finds Thul's corpse in the bridge, she immediately uses the neuromod to restore her original, ruthless personality.|I Am Not A Monster|2018|VideoGame|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/IAmNotAMonster

Shadow Archetype|Under the Knife 2 has three notable examples: Adel Tulba to Derek. The latter possesses the Healing Touch naturally, but suffers a Heroic BSoD that causes him to lose the ability to use it. Adel too is deeply affected when he learns that this caused Derek to back out of an operation meant to save him, which had to be completed by Dr. Hoffman. The difference between the two is reflected by their reactions to these crises: Derek pushes himself to continue working and eventually forces himself to remember why he became a doctor in the first place, which makes him regain his Healing Touch. Meanwhile, Adel leaves Caduceus for the Hands of Asclepius and gains an artificial Healing Touch through Neo-GUILT therapy, which eventually causes him to succumb to dementia and shock, forcing Derek to save him. Reina Mayuzumi to Director Hoffman. The latter is naturally able to use the Healing Touch, but grows extremely reluctant to use it after he loses a patient despite his abilities, and is always wary not to exceed his limits. Meanwhile, Mayuzumi uses the Aletheia strain of Neo-GUILT to retain her young looks, and intends to introduce the use of Neo-GUILT treatment on a large scale despite being aware of the risks posed by its nigh-inevitable failure, only stopping once it has an effect on her. Patrick Mercer to Professor Blackwell. The latter was forced to become a Delphi researcher against his will to ensure the safety of his daughter Angie, whom he genuinely loves and esteems, readily agreeing to help fight GUILT afterwards. On the other hand, Mercer is a bureaucrat in charge of medical research involving GUILT who ends up using it for his own ends, wanting to exploit its properties to bring his wife out of a coma, willfully shunning his daughter Heather in the process and not showing any remorse in being responsible for the suffering caused by Neo-GUILT.

Shadow Archetype|"There exist ""higher level"" zombies, some of which bear a resemblance to more limited versions of the players: Big, lug-wrench carriers tank like Blitzers, and at low health use a kamikaze tackle similar to the classes' special. Bone and skull-clad zombies run faster than the others and dash in like Boxers. An uncommon variety of zombie raises short-lived walls to protect itself and provide cover for their ranged support (a Firefighter specialty). The zombies have many baseball pitchers of their own, and their diminutive ""Little Leaguers"" actually possess and use some of the combat items players have access to. One of the highest-end zombies is a punk singer carrying a microphone stand which produces chains of lightning which pull players in, stun them and flail them down."|Brawl Busters|2011|VideoGame|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BrawlBusters

Additionally, Otus remains open-minded and welcomes Alphonse and Twig into the party with open arms, despite their past actions. Solus is so unable to trust others, he refuses to even explain to Otus what he's doing, willing to fight because he's so certain Otus and the others won't trust him.|Owlboy|2016|VideoGame|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Owlboy

In the end, Avery's ""utopia"" turns out to be a lie, and the greed of himself and the other pirates destroys them all. While Nate, Ross, and to a lesser extent Sam, are able to let go of their greed and escape a similar fate, Rafe's vindictiveness and hunger for glory results in him being the only major character of the game to die.

And both prefer to dream of happier things rather than face reality. The difference is that Polaris eventually did grew out of her lonely shell while Almond was isolated in a mental ward.

And also jokes that she planted a bomb in their heads, just in case they tried escaping their punishment. Doremy notes that Byakuren's dream self is awfully similar to her real self, and assumes that it's because of her training. Miko's wishes to govern Gensokyo with an iron fist and purge it of evil. Mamizou's dream self also wants to rule Gensokyo with an iron fist, to the extent of wanting to go outside of Gensokyo and conquer all of Japan, but Doremy also notes she has nightmares of humans from the Outside World. Koishi doesn't dream at all. Mokou's dream self is awfully quiet, and Doremy suggests that Mokou has given up on having dreams. A line from Doremy implies that Jo'on's dream self Just Wants To Be Normal, while Shion always dreams about food. Kasen's dream self tries to pull a We Can Rule Together with Jo'on. Probably an allusion to her past self as The Cunning and Treacherous Oni, from Wild and Horned Hermit. Tenshi's dream self wishes to destroy all of existence and create a world free from sadness and poverty.

Shadow Archetype|The Guardians are mirrors that reflect their masters' wills.|Crystar|2018|VideoGame|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Crystar
Shadow Archetype|"A lot of people are just like you, Harry. Kim Kitsuragi is a highly logical Consummate Professional who disregards the insane ramblings of the insane people around him, with Authority off the charts - but he can play along with these antics if it gets him an edge. This isn't too far off from a Logical, Boring Cop high in Morale who ignores the stupid shit his brain has to say to him. Garte is an asshole trying to hide his fuckups and constantly irritated at the world falling to pieces around him, and eventually figures out he's not afraid of death after doing something monumentally stupid. He also has a tendency to claim he doesn't care for people; it's implied one of the reasons Harry joined the RCM was because he gave a shit, and with high enough Empathy, Harry can note Garte really WAS trying to protect the rest of the people inside the hostel as best as he could. Idiot Doom Spiral changes his background on a dime, makes bullshit up (and also hides the fact his downfall likely hinged on things besides his keys), pushes people away, and is powered on alcohol. One of Harry's thoughts sarcastically notes that this chain of events couldn't have happened to a nicer guy. Rene Arnoux is a spitfire, but frail fascist holding on to the glory days, his long-dead lover, and calling everyone he doesn't like a communist. This isn't unlike a Fascist Harry who romanticises the past, especially that bit about his lover, and Harries with very low PHYS are heavily implied to die soon after the events of the game, if not during it. Whatever your choices, Rene dies on Day Five, stubbornly trying to do his job. Klaasje's a drug-addicted mess who is still very, very good at what she does - not far off from cops with high Electrochemistry, or Harry before the amnesia. In addition, the ID you find is implied to be her real ID, but using an outdated photo - just like Harry's. Evrart Claire is fond of saying stupid shit, playing along with the stupid shit of other people, mocking people to their faces, and dealing in corrupt bargaining. This is all in service to a genuine goal and idea, especially for Communist Cops, and especially for players who were able to get the Hardie Boys to talk. Measurehead is a meathead who believes in extremely illogical race ideas and enforcing them with force. - which a Harry who believes in racism, nationalism, strength, and stupid things like The Remote Viewers' Division can believe in, too. Alain is all too eager to prod back at you, and it's clear it's to try and get people to expose themselves, similar to what Harry was like as ""the Human Can Opener"", talking to get people to overextend themselves and reveal weaknesses. Post-Tribunal, he can very likely end up like Harry and Ellis: a sorry, guilt-ridden drunken mess of a man who'll die soon, either at his own hands or due to his antics. It takes a lot of talking and bonding, but Joyce Messier is, deep down, just like Harry. She longs for her past and is implied to long for a romance she had in Martinaise, just like Harry and ""her"". Even Boring Cops will have their brains talk to them to encourage them to do dumb shit - and Joyce's admission that her sanity is just a mask isn't that far off from the justification a Boring Cop can use. Both of them avoid talking about the pale, with the implication that they've both been exposed to it for too long, and that the both of them know there's not enough time left - either for the world, or for their sanity. If you suss this out, you two can share a knowing goodbye before she leaves. Who's the Crab Man? A middle-aged man involved in an everyday trade who suddenly began a violent downward spiral and came out the other side babbling about nonsense and worshipping ""her"", due to pale exposure. The Hanged Man has all the facets of every possible Harry. He was a violent drug addict threatening to kill everyone and everything in the name of racism, political ideas, or even because he can, just like Harry. He was in a slow, destructive, world-ending spiral prior to the game beginning, just like Harry. Despite his flaws, he attracted a woman who saw past his tough exterior and left him all the same, just like Harry. Art Cops will note Raul claims Lely dabbled in the arts. Human Can Openers will hear Raul say that if Lely was here, he could have talked them all down, despite everything pointing to failure - not unlike Harry being able to open up a blustering Titus and his Boys with only a few words. Apocalypse Cops will heed the fact that his drunken, genocidal ramblings about the world coming to an end sound quite a lot like theirs - on top of the fact it's HEAVILY implied both Lely and Harry were screaming into tape recorders the night of the murder. Druggie Cops will be pleased to hear that he loved his booze and drugs to drown out the world and loved the ladies, too. Corrupt Cops will empathise with the fact his unit worked for the just-as-corrupt Oranjese megacorps. And if you take the bad thing that happened at the Church that involved Harry at face value, you're potentially an atrocity-committing wreck, just like the Hanged Man leading the horrific violation and murder of a Semenese woman. Speaking of The Hanged Man, the rest of his unit qualifies. de Paule was one of the mercs investigating after the murder and uses every piece of evidence available in the encounter. When she first speaks, the narrator notes she is oddly stoic. She's not far off from Kim in these regards. Ruud is an incomprensible, sorry mountain of a man. If you have high perception, it's heavily implied his whispering is him quoting literature - not far off from an Art Cop or someone with high Inland Empire - and is heavily implied to have been grieving Lely's death by drinking himself to near death, not unlike Harry's decades-long attempted suicide after ""she"" left. Raul can further reveal Ruud was one of the most brutal people on the unit. So was Harry in his Precinct. The Deserter, a violent communist all too eager to blame everything on the ""ruling class"" and kill them, too. What's more is that it's implied he can hear not only La Revacholiere like a Harry who has, but also other Cryptids like a Harry who ascribes to the Col Do Ma Ma Daqua Cryptid, and, finally, a devil figure - Iblis. ""Shaitan"". The total opposite of the Messianic Dolores Dei. During the ending, Jean will compare you and him to Torson and McLaine, two cowboy cops who're ""an iconic duo"" like you two - except Jean will quickly point out you two are iconic for being clinically depressed men, and they are not. Kim Kitsuragi is a highly logical Consummate Professional who disregards the insane ramblings of the insane people around him, with Authority off the charts - but he can play along with these antics if it gets him an edge. This isn't too far off from a Logical, Boring Cop high in Morale who ignores the stupid shit his brain has to say to him. Klaasje's a drug-addicted mess who is still very, very good at what she does - not far off from cops with high Electrochemistry, or Harry before the amnesia.

Split Personality|Gahan Wilson's ghost suffers from this, due to the result of a formula he drank. One personality is good, the other is evil, and it is difficult to tell which one is in control at first glance. Part of the difficulty of dealing with Gahan is that Evil Gahan will often pretend to be Good Gahan so that he can mock you and steal one of your items after you give him one. The way to tell the two apart is to look at the direction their feet are pointing and listen to the noise Gahan makes when he appears; if it makes a high pitched shuddering noise, Good Gahan's feet point to your right, Evil Gahan's feet point to your left. If he makes a low warbling noise, the reverse is true.|The Ultimate Haunted House|1993|VideoGame|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheUltimateHauntedHouse

Split Personality|The Smiths; it's on the box cover. But when it comes to whose personality they split from, Covers Always Lie. However, they're not regular split personalities, instead being examples of something called Multifoliate Personae Phenomenon, which is why they're seemingly able to physically manifest. To make matters even crazier about the history of  the Smiths, the supplementary material seem to say that they were already dead when Emir killed them, and Harman had been using them as split personalities as the Killer7 syndicate. So, they've been killed at least twice, can apparently manifest themselves separately from one another, and can be endlessly resurrected by Garcian/Emir. And Samantha used to be one, but isn't anymore, so it's apparently possible for a personality to leave and regain their body... somehow. Samantha at least comes off as an example, switching between Meido and Alpha Bitch depending on whether or not the lights are on. Same with Yoon-Hyun, who puts on a mask to switch from his cordial demeanor to the abrasive True Mask. The Smiths; it's on the box cover.

After Shirou learns this lesson, the two souls are able to merge. Satan Gaul from Orion appears to have this as well, being able to change in no less than three personas with different hair colours and levels of craziness when he shakes his head. His calmest personality has light orange hair, which is relatively straight, while his most agressive one has very spiky dark red hair. His default personality is somewhere in between and has orange-red hair. Also, from Orion, Ichihoshi turns out to have DID in episode 13, with Hikaru being his real personality and Mitsuru being the split personality of his deceased brother, who formed inside his mind due to being in denial about his brother's death.

Split Personality|Subverted. Ethan is suggested to have one, and certainly has a disturbing set of symptoms and an equally-concerned shrink. It turns out, however, that his other self is not the Origami Killer. These elements were originally part of a sub-plot where Shelby's presence at Ethan's accident led to an unexplained psychic link between the two; this link meant that Ethan would travel to the place where Shelby's brother died and unconsciously fold paper cranes at the same time Shelby did after he took a victim.

Split Personality|Goal gets a variation on this in Chaos on Deponia - her mind was stored on hard-disk-like brain implant, but after some Rufus-related shenanigans the data on it is split into three disks, each of which contains a third of Goal's personality. Rufus can use a remote control to flip Goal between her selves. Tuning in the right Goal for the right situation is a core mechanic of the game. Goal's parts are: Baby Goal: Childish, cheery, and naive. Baby Goal is the most optimistic and supportive, but also the most easily manipulated. Lady Goal: Arrogant, aloof, and utterly disgusted with the filth and low class of Deponia. Lady Goal seems to be the most intelligent and reasonable, but that doesn't mean she'll be sympathetic.  She's the one who remembers the Ascension Codes to reach Elysium, and she also betrays Rufus and her other parts to run off with Cletus. Spunky Goal: Adventurous, impatient, and bold. Spunky Goal is only slightly less brash than Rufus himself, on top of being stronger and more aggressive. She's arguably the facet of Goal who gets along best with Rufus. Literal Split Personality: Near the end of the game, parts of her end up in the body of someone else, and then proceed to argue with the original body.|Deponia|2012|VideoGame|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Deponia

Split Personality|"An after effect of using the Valkyrie System's Overdrive feature. Luna is the first to show symptoms of this, turning from humble if somewhat ignorant rich girl into someone who's quite snobbish and in Asahi's own words acts like ""a queen"". Later on, after the mission to rescue Coo and Amal's father, the remaining female members of Valkyrie Force develop one as well. For the most part they take developing these personalities relatively well, being far more concerned with the prospect of it being early stages of Chimeraization rather than the psychological damages they've suffered, thanks to knowing that it would happen to them in the first place. Bitch in Sheep's Clothing: Ai tends to behave as she normally does before switching into a more abrasive tone and mocking anyone who believes that the normal Ai is anything more than a facade, insisting that she is and always has been the real Ai. The Baroness: Luna treats everyone as being beneath her. They are servants at best, but far more frequently little more than animals there for her own personal amusement. Extreme Doormat: Yue simply can not function without orders, quickly slipping into a locked up panic if someone is not actively ordering her to do anything. Failure to issue orders leads her to start interpreting anything as one, necessitating a ""Wait for further orders"" order just to wait her out. Insufferable Genius: Coo is much like Luna in that everyone is beneath her. Unlike Luna she simply sees everyone as so completely and utterly incompetent and that if she would just be given control of everything things would be so much better. Yandere: Amal becomes violently obsessed with Asahi, which leaves him doing everything he can to avoid setting her off on a murderous rampage. Amal herself is concerned about her other self, Oh, Crap! being her reaction to piecing together Asahi's vague explanation of her behaviors."|Dark Rose Valkyrie|2016|VideoGame|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkRoseValkyrie
Split Personality|Several characters. Irenka Bauer switches back and forth between her own personality and that of Helena, a character in a play she has memorized. This is perhaps the most classic example, as context indicates she developed the Helena personality due to the traumatic events of the Aug Incident and its aftermath, and switches to it as a means of shielding herself from additional trauma. Vince Black at first appears to be a standard case of an undercover agent Becoming the Mask, but the more Jensen follows his trail, the greater the indications of Sanity Slippage. This culminates in a pocket secretary found in Black's apartment, containing an email exchange between his criminal and cop identities. Daria is ultimately revealed to have been implanted with a personality chip, ostensibly to cure her of severe social anxiety. Unfortunately, the donor personality used to create the chip began to dominate her own... and was taken from a convicted serial killer!

Split Personality|"The alpha v1.9 update gives Saiko this. With a new intro revealing the two personalities, one that's obsessive and possessive but outwardly friendly and a ""Him"" personality that is more outright threatening (with a much bigger and more sadistic-looking smile to boot). The alpha 2.0 implemented this in gameplay, as various actions the player takes or doesn't take will influence which is in control. In her Yandere State, she fawns over Akira but also concentrates on trapping and preventing him from escaping. Upon discovering the player, she'll remain by their side and remain clingy. Any step the player takes to escape (finding keys, unlocking rooms, etc.) will cause her to knock the player out or to demand they hand over whatever they found; she can even physically choke the player and steal the key from him. Not watching her guarantees she'll jump onto the player's back, and she'll knock them out if the player tries to enter a room. She isn't above helping out if you get too banged up, but the health potions she gives you can sometimes be drugged to make you fall asleep or poisoned. In her Yangire State, she's out for Akira's blood and will take every chance she gets to attack you while also being faster to boot. She'll actively trap doorways with broken glass, vault desks and open windows, and try to stab the player for massive damage if she gets close enough. Occasionally, she'll even throw her knife in order to slow the player so she can strangle them to death. While there is a distinction in behavior between personalities for Akira, however, Yandere Mode seems to show that both are fairly indistinguishable for anyone else, save for her Yandere State laughing a bit less often and being much more serious about ending Shinji's life."|Saiko No Sutoka|2020|VideoGame|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaikoNoSutoka
