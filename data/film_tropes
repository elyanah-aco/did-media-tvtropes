Alternate Identity Amnesia|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateIdentityAmnesia|"This trope is about characters with a form of Involuntary Shapeshifting or Superpowered Evil Side that causes them to suffer amnesia whenever they transform to their alternate form or self. Typically this trope is most often used in media with werewolves (or any other sort of werecreatures), though characters with a Jekyll And Hyde style Split Personality, Demonic Possession, Mind Control, or an Enemy Within may also suffer from this form of amnesia. When it happens it may be immediately noticeable to the character; they will freak out at suffering blackouts and waking up naked in a field, covered in blood, and surrounded by animal carcassesnote(hopefully it'll be just animal carcasses; human body parts are also a distinct possibility).
 In some cases the amnesiac lycanthrope actually suffers a combination of Laser-Guided Amnesia and Weirdness Censor about the Missing Time; they might spend weeks, months or years unaware of their condition. It helps if they transition into a type of ""sleepwalker"" that walks home and cleans up post transformation. The smarter the alternate form is the likelier this is to happen, since it'll likely want its host to stay unawares as long as possible.
 One dangerous possibility is for characters to become a Zombie Infectee who willfully ignores or rationalizes away any evidence, symptoms, and lost memories. Whether they cop to it or not, expect Amnesiac Dissonance to kick in once they feel the weight of their crimes.
 Typically the memories are merely repressed and come back in a Past Experience Nightmare flashback sequence. If the lycanthopy can be controlled, then learning to do so usually enables the character to remember past events as well as remain lucid and in control during future ones. Occasionally the memories really are irrecoverable, usually if the character is essentially comatose while someone/thing else is in control.
 The explanation for the blackouts is usually that ""the wolf"" has taken over and puts the character to sleep or in the passenger's seat. It's worth noting that the alternate identity isn't necessarily hostile to the character note(indeed, they usually depend on them to exist, save for cases where they plan to pull a Split-Personality Takeover) and in these cases both personalities may try desperately to find means to communicate.
 Contrast And I Must Scream, when the lycanthrope is aware of what's going on but helpless to stop their wolf-self. Compare What Did I Do Last Night?, the alcohol-induced version. Compare The Killer in Me, especially the ""Amnesiac Killer"" type. Compare Trauma-Induced Amnesia, which is also fairly common in disassociative disorders. Compare also Identity Amnesia and Amnesiac Dissonance.
 This is probably the most ""realistic"" presentation of classic multiple personality/dissociative identity disorder  the individual identities may not be aware of the existence or experiences of the other identities, and consequently suffer from time disturbances. It's one of the most frightening things about Real Life multiplicity, especially considering its use in this trope, to the point of stereotype. People in real life who know they're multiple may not come out even to close friends, fearing it's the first thing that'll come to mind. Amnesia is also not true for all real-life multiples across the board, and if someone tells you they do know what their other selves said and did, they are likely telling you the truth. Today's psychotherapy for multiples focuses not on fusion but on communication. Many have worked out their own system, leaving notes or voicemails for one another."|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FightClub|The protagonist doesn't remember any of his alter-ego activities.|Fight Club|1999|Film

Enemy Within|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyWithin|"A specific form of Split Personality. Maybe the Body Horror became a bit too fused with someone. Maybe the Unstoppable Rage is getting... too unstoppable. Perhaps The Atoner's past is taking on a life of its own. A half-human's Demon / Vampire self is trying to take control, or that Deal with the Devil is hitting a bit too close to home.
 Either way, the enemy is behind the hero's eyes, and its time is coming when it can take over. Until then, it'll do all it can to control him and get him to give in to its Horror Hunger. The thing to stress most is that the Enemy Within is the hero. He or she cannot simply exorcise it out. Often the Enemy Within is the cause of the powers that the hero has that allows them to do what they do. With Great Power Comes Great Insanity, remember?
 Often, since Evil Is Cool and Evil Feels Good, other characters may realize the danger before the hero and need to convince him.
 This trope has received criticism from the mental health community, as it is accused of demonising patients with Dissociative Identity Disorder (or DID), and being seen as one of the reasons for stigmatization against people with DID due to its constant use in media. This was most notably seen in the backlash against Split (2016), whose potrayal of DID was seen by many to be VERY damaging.
 Not to be confused with the expansion pack to the X-Com reboot, nor an unrelated TV series, or another unrelated novel. Contrast Enemy Without. Compare Jekyll & Hyde.

Enemy Without|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyWithout|"When someone's inner darkness doesn't quite take over someone, but it does ""escape"" their body and rampage. Fighting someone else's Enemy Without is tricky, as often it will either kill the person projecting it if it dies, or it will just resurrect itself until the actual darkness in the hero's heart is dealt with by the hero themselves.
 Often symbolically represents repression, and the hero's refusal to acknowledge the darkness within or some other aspect of themselves. Victory is achieved half the time via ""reintegrating"" with it. The other half of of the time it can be seen as representing some inner demon, and thus, it must be abandoned, purged, or confronted and conquered.
 Sometimes this battle will occur inside someone's own head in a dreamscape, making it both the Enemy Within and the Enemy Without at the same time. It may require saying ""I'm Not Afraid of You!"" to weaken it enough to beat.
 This trope is very similar to The Heartless, Made of Evil, and Literal Split Personality. It is distinguished from The Heartless by having some personal connection to the person/people it was created from, from Made of Evil because the Enemy may be flesh and bone, and from Literal Split Personality by leaving behind a clearly-defined original character.
 See also: Evil Twin, Enemy Within, Ghost in the Machine, Self-Constructed Being, Shadow Archetype, Indulgent Fantasy Segue, Mental Monster, Tulpa, Powering Villain Realization, and Residual Evil Entity. Very dangerous in combination with Superpowered Evil Side.

Evil Twin|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin|"Two family members (who happen to look identical) who are moral opposites of one another. Typically done with literal twins, these characters are of the same generation, but may have been raised as ""cousins"", or even completely separated from one another. It's especially popular in a Soap Opera, where they can use an Identical Twin Mistake to wreak havoc with their Good Twin's life.
 Typically the evil twin will be portrayed by the same actor as the regular character. It's worth noting that in the overwhelming majority of cases the twin is evil; only rarely does an evil character suddenly find themselves contending with a good twin, and in those cases the good version is often simpleminded or purely comic. See Good Is Impotent and Impersonating the Evil Twin.
 The evil twin may attempt to convince their good twin that they aren't so different, saying We Can Rule Together and that the good twin's friends are holding them back from greatness. This often ends with a Mirror Match as neither one will be able to convince the other of their ideology. After the fight, their allies will usually need to Spot the Imposter to figure out who won.
 A goatee or other beard is less common for Evil Twins than they are for typical Evil Counterpart examples, because it distorts the use of Always Identical Twins. However, other Identical Twin ID Tag tropes are still used to differentiate between the good/evil twins, such as scars and evil costuming. Very often, one twin will be right-handed and the other left-handed. Guess which one's which.
 This trope is Played for Laughs when both twins are evil, or when a character on the side of the good guys has a good twin show up, implying that the original is the evil one. Sub-Trope of Always Identical Twins (siblings are Doppelgangers), Evil Counterpart (any evil Foil to a character), and Evil Doppelgnger (someone who is both a Doppelgnger and Evil Counterpart). Sister Trope to Evil Knockoff (intentionally created evil duplicate), Cain and Abel (non-twin siblings where one is good and the other is evil), and Criminal Doppelgnger (evil Identical Stranger). Super-Trope to Evil Brunette Twin, where the Always Identical Twins have different hair colours (and the darker one is evil).

However, other Identical Twin ID Tag tropes are still used to differentiate between the good/evil twins, such as scars and evil costuming. Very often, one twin will be right-handed and the other left-handed. Guess which one's which.
 This trope is Played for Laughs when both twins are evil, or when a character on the side of the good guys has a good twin show up, implying that the original is the evil one. Sub-Trope of Always Identical Twins (siblings are Doppelgangers), Evil Counterpart (any evil Foil to a character), and Evil Doppelgnger (someone who is both a Doppelgnger and Evil Counterpart).

 The evil twin may attempt to convince their good twin that they aren't so different, saying We Can Rule Together and that the good twin's friends are holding them back from greatness.

Gollum Made Me Do It|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GollumMadeMeDoIt|"A character has another personality to keep him company, but has a problem: the other personality isn't exactly a model citizen. However, he is... persuasive. More often than not he finds himself being bullied or coerced into following his darker half's advice, even if it's advice he wouldn't have followed normally. This is in contrast to the conventional Split Personality, where each exists without the knowledge of the other, though in this case this will still sometimes be true to an extent.
 Of course, even if the character doesn't really have a Split Personality, making people think they do is a common opening gambit if they're planning to make an Insanity Defense (or just to get the hero to let his guard down). And if you're looking at a guy pleading with you to save him from his evil other half, how are you gonna tell the difference?
 You'll usually find such a character Talking to Themself, sometimes pleading with himself, trying to convince, warn or downright resist his other half.
 In terms of personality types, expect the evil half to be a dominant, forceful, assertive type, and the good half to be more moral and reluctant to hurt people, which the evil half will see as weak. Getting the weak half to reassert control usually requires it face the evil half by saying something along the lines of ""I'm Not Afraid of You!""

Hearing Voices|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HearingVoices|"Whenever characters start hearing the Voice of the Legion whisper in their ear, or the Black Speech dancing on the wind, there's something bad in store for them... and it comes in four flavors!  Insanity Berry, Evil Sauce, Good Mint, and Chaotic Neutral Licorice.
 Insane  Bob's completely lost his mind, but how can we make that plain to the audience? Simple  Have him mention hearing voices in his head, or depict him conversing with them. Closely related to Split Personality. If Bob is a telepath suffering from Power Incontinence, the voices may actually be the cause of his madness, rather than a symptom.
 Evil  The evil version can come from a lot of sources. Demonic Possession, nearby ghosts, Artifacts of Doom and Tomes of Eldritch Lore. The Demon/Spirit/Artifact(s) possessing Bob may serve as the ""evil"" shoulder angel, and rather than (or in addition to) forcing him to do evil, tells him to. As Bob realizes Evil Feels Good, the demon can then claim that it didn't make Bob do anything he didn't want to.
 Thanks to a deal with Trope Co., for an unlimited time, we've got two new flavors, Sour Good and Mystery flavor. Except in Nebraska, something about Trope Co. and several hundred liters of Psycho Serum.
 Good  The voices come from a higher power, often God or angels. Rather than compel Bob to go on a killing spree, they'll offer him guidance, and likely encourage pacifism. Or cause him to become a Knight Templar...
 Chaotic Neutral  It's often unknown where the voices are coming from, whether the source is holy, unholy, or neutral is never delved into. Or even Maybe Magic, Maybe Mundane. Alternatively, the voices come from a multitude of sources, some good, some evil.
 Interestingly, Bob may not actually be hearing voices  a common variation is for Alice to make him think he is, using a hidden radio transmitter or the like. If that's the case, see Gaslighting.

The Heartless|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeartless|"The Heartless are monsters born out of people's negative emotions. They can be a special case of Body Horror, but can also be a part of the victim's Soul Anatomy that has been separated from them, and like a ghost they may not have a physical body at all  in which case, they may be considered a kind of Tulpa. This part of the soul may represent all of a person's animalistic desires without any of the restraint, similar to a Jekyll & Hyde situation, or all of their feelings of suffering, sadness, and anger condensed into a distinct figure. They can be a convenient Monster of the Week since they are an unlimited resource; there always seem to be plenty of victims loaded with problems and angst for The Heartless to feed on. They can also have a self-propagating ""zombie"" effect.
 The trouble for the heroes is that these are difficult to get rid of, especially if The Heartless still displays an awareness of the world (usually, as a ruse of the Enigmatic Minion). If an established character becomes one of The Heartless, they may act as if they have undergone a FaceHeel Turn.
 The All-Loving Hero's power is usually to combat The Heartless or even to heal them. The Anti-Hero or Well-Intentioned Extremist usually insists the victims are too far gone and should be put down before more people get hurt. Occasionally, a victim who is Fighting from the Inside can resist The Heartless' control.
 Depending on the context, this trope may be a subtrope of Abstract Apotheosis. This is because nearly every series that this trope is used in presents these critters as An Aesop about them being in everyone's hearts. Contrast/See also Made of Evil.

 Depending on the context, this trope may be a subtrope of Abstract Apotheosis. This is because nearly every series that this trope is used in presents these critters as An Aesop about them being in everyone's hearts. Contrast/See also Made of Evil.

Heroic Safe Mode|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSafeMode|"Heroism is hazardous work for both the body and the mind: it's fairly common for heroes to end up facing at least one emotionally, mentally, or psychically charged event capable of causing a Heroic Blue Screen Of Death that temporarily renders them catatonic. Of course, this wouldn't be a gripping New York Times Best Seller if it didn't happen at the worst possible time to ramp up the tension as the audience is left hoping the Side Kick can protect the hero until he or she snaps out of it.
 Keeping the computing metaphor, some heroes have a heartier Operating System than the norm, which when faced with the Heroic BSoD instead enters Heroic Safe Mode. During this period the hero ""shuts down"" non-essential thought processes and focuses entirely on ""fight or flight"", hoping that when the danger is over they can ""restart"" in safety. Especially strong-willed heroes who go into Safe Mode while loved ones are in danger will usually protect them to near-suicidal extremes. In other cases, they may wind up snapping at their own friends who try to push them out of Safe Mode. Luckily, these loved ones can usually push the restart button with a Cooldown Hug. They will (at best) talk in monosyllables, become either completely emotionless or absolutely enraged, but they will always, always terrify friend and foe alike with an unfiltered Death Glare. When a hero fully reboots from this mode back into their standard operating procedure, Post-Victory Collapse usually kicks in, or the full-on Heroic BSoD may kick in after the direct danger to the hero and/or their companions has passed. It is often seen as the good counterpart of a Villainous Breakdown.
 Where this gets interesting is if the hero has a Split Personality or Adaptive Armor that is not normally in the driver's seat. With the hero ""out to lunch"", the passenger may decide to take survival into his, her or its own hands (neurons?) and control their body until the hero is well again. This varies depending on the nature of the Split Personality. For example, a soul-bound Empathic Weapon might default to Attack! Attack! Attack!, while a more evil Enemy Within might decide it's a good time to unlock the hero's Superpowered Evil Side.
 Once they reboot, they may well regret having not helped save someone, run away, or killed many dozens of mooks... but as friends will remind him, at least he (and they) are still alive.
 This is Truth in Television to a greater degree than a lot of Split Personality Tropes. Many traumatized people deal with their pain by creating a kind of secondary self who is less bothered by the pain because this self is just observing while ""that other self"" is actually experiencing the pain. This function may be one reason for the existence of the Real Life, non-Hollywood Psychology phenomenon of people who have a Split Personality. And people who are multiple in real life and usually operate as a Split-Personality Team may find that in a high-stress situation, some calmer or more competent individual may shove their way to the front and remain there for the duration.
 In a less extreme form, it is considered a healthy coping mechanism. People using this strategy to deal with dangerous or otherwise overwhelming situations will often say to themselves something like, ""I have to focus on survival right now. I'll deal with these feelings later."" This is different from repression because the person is not trying to forget or suppress emotions, only to delay dealing with them until it's safe to do so. People capable of shifting focus away from their own emotions, without suppressing them, are often very resilient; so this is a trait often seen in characters whose professions often take them into emotionally charged situations  soldiers, emergency workers, spies, police, superheroes, and similar.

Identity Amnesia|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdentityAmnesia|"Amnesia comes easy in fiction. It is also conveniently specific. A taste of Applied Phlebotinum, a particularly shocking traumatic event, or even a simple Tap on the Head will be sufficient to make your character forget all about who or what they are.
 In most cases, the character has simply lost their memories, no longer remembering their name, loved ones or where they came from. This is often the cause for a Quest for Identity.
 Sometimes, however, it is their personality that has changed. Not only do they not remember who they were, they are convinced that they are someone else entirely. In essence, Bob doesn't just forget that he's Bob, but he thinks he's Alice instead...
 The affected character may have additional amnesia on top of their personality change, but it's not a guarantee. It's possible they may still know everything they did prior to the switch, except that they've never before acted the way they're acting now. Attempts to get them to remember previous life-defining events that may snap them out of it are likely to be met with a stern dismissal: ""Why do you keep talking about this ""Bob"" guy?! I haven't time for this! I'm a world-famous opera singer and must be on stage in one hour!""
 Just like other forms of TV amnesia, this variety is often rectified by just smacking the character in the head a second time; they are usually very resistant to seeking out help on their own. As far as they're concerned, nothing is wrong.
 Once restored, they'll probably have no recollection of their amnesia-induced alter ego, and will probably be puzzled as to why time has moved forward by several hours/days.
 Once their Jekyll & Hyde nature has been demonstrated, it's a foregone conclusion that should the character in question get tapped on the head at a later date, the alternate persona will be right back in the saddle again.

They may move to a different town and assume a different identity, without being aware the new identity is false. It is a very, very rare result of a psychotic break. Dissociative amnesia can also parallel this trope, but also under very rare and extreme circumstances.
 Clinical identity amnesia is the inability to identify with things you have done or said. You still remember who you are, but have no memory of having done certain things. You're just as likely (or more) to disown good deeds as bad ones.

Jekyll & Hyde|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JekyllAndHyde|"When a character and his Evil Twin, Evil Counterpart, or Shadow Archetype are really the same guy after all. Or, sometimes, a completely different character is sharing body space with another. The point is, the villain lives inside the hero's body, and therefore hides in plain sight. The hero is trying to catch himself.
 If the two personalities are aware of each other, this becomes a case of Gollum Made Me Do It. For a more mundane version, see Mood-Swinger. See In Vino Veritas if the change is alcohol-induced (you could call it ""Dr Jekyll and Mr Jack Daniels""). As an evil Hyde personality's crimes are outside the good Jekylls control and the Jekyll is usually unable to stop the Hyde emerging, this is often a case of being Driven to Villainy.
 Sometimes, though, the Hyde is not really evil; it may just be more instinctual or capable of using violence when necessary... See Wikipedia Behavior for the wiki version of this, also known as ""Dr. Pedia and Mr. Trope"". Also, a ""Jekyll"" persona isn't necessarily entirely ""good"" either  it may just be subtler or more self-controlled. After all, in the original story, Jekyll created Hyde as an outlet for his darker impulses, thus acknowledging that he had such impulses. Occasionally, the situation can be resolved (not necessarily favorably) with a Split-Personality Takeover, or with a Split-Personality Merge that reconciles both sides into a healthy whole. See also Superpowered Evil Side and Helpless Good Side.
 The trope name comes, of course, from The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, by Robert Louis Stevenson. The dual nature of Jekyll was actually originally a Twist Ending in the case of that story, but the book became famous and now it no longer surprises anyone. Most adaptations of the work focus on the dichotomy from the start. Other occurrences of the trope may still manage to surprise if theyre well done.
 The real-life example of Deacon Brodie (cabinet-making pillar of the church by day, burglar by night) is said to have inspired Stevenson, as did the story of Horace Wells, a pioneer of medical anesthetics. While researching chloroform by testing various dosages on himself, Wells unknowingly built up a dangerous level of the drug in his system, and ultimately attacked two prostitutes with sulfuric acid in a state of intoxicated paranoia. He then committed suicide after sobering up and learning what he had done.
 Since the fact that the hero and the villain are the same person could often be used as a twist ending, beware of spoilers on this page.

 If the two personalities are aware of each other, this becomes a case of Gollum Made Me Do It. For a more mundane version, see Mood-Swinger. See In Vino Veritas if the change is alcohol-induced (you could call it ""Dr Jekyll and Mr Jack Daniels""). As an evil Hyde personality's crimes are outside the good Jekylls control and the Jekyll is usually unable to stop the Hyde emerging, this is often a case of being Driven to Villainy.
 Sometimes, though, the Hyde is not really evil; it may just be more instinctual or capable of using violence when necessary...

 The trope name comes, of course, from The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, by Robert Louis Stevenson. The dual nature of Jekyll was actually originally a Twist Ending in the case of that story, but the book became famous and now it no longer surprises anyone. Most adaptations of the work focus on the dichotomy from the start. Other occurrences of the trope may still manage to surprise if theyre well done.
 The real-life example of Deacon Brodie (cabinet-making pillar of the church by day, burglar by night) is said to have inspired Stevenson, as did the story of Horace Wells, a pioneer of medical anesthetics. While researching chloroform by testing various dosages on himself, Wells unknowingly built up a dangerous level of the drug in his system, and ultimately attacked two prostitutes with sulfuric acid in a state of intoxicated paranoia. He then committed suicide after sobering up and learning what he had done.

Jekyll & Hyde|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JekyllAndHyde|"When a character and his Evil Twin, Evil Counterpart, or Shadow Archetype are really the same guy after all. Or, sometimes, a completely different character is sharing body space with another. The point is, the villain lives inside the hero's body, and therefore hides in plain sight. The hero is trying to catch himself.
 If the two personalities are aware of each other, this becomes a case of Gollum Made Me Do It. For a more mundane version, see Mood-Swinger. See In Vino Veritas if the change is alcohol-induced (you could call it ""Dr Jekyll and Mr Jack Daniels""). As an evil Hyde personality's crimes are outside the good Jekylls control and the Jekyll is usually unable to stop the Hyde emerging, this is often a case of being Driven to Villainy.
 Sometimes, though, the Hyde is not really evil; it may just be more instinctual or capable of using violence when necessary... See Wikipedia Behavior for the wiki version of this, also known as ""Dr. Pedia and Mr. Trope"". Also, a ""Jekyll"" persona isn't necessarily entirely ""good"" either  it may just be subtler or more self-controlled. After all, in the original story, Jekyll created Hyde as an outlet for his darker impulses, thus acknowledging that he had such impulses. Occasionally, the situation can be resolved (not necessarily favorably) with a Split-Personality Takeover, or with a Split-Personality Merge that reconciles both sides into a healthy whole. See also Superpowered Evil Side and Helpless Good Side.
 The trope name comes, of course, from The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, by Robert Louis Stevenson. The dual nature of Jekyll was actually originally a Twist Ending in the case of that story, but the book became famous and now it no longer surprises anyone. Most adaptations of the work focus on the dichotomy from the start. Other occurrences of the trope may still manage to surprise if theyre well done.
 The real-life example of Deacon Brodie (cabinet-making pillar of the church by day, burglar by night) is said to have inspired Stevenson, as did the story of Horace Wells, a pioneer of medical anesthetics. While researching chloroform by testing various dosages on himself, Wells unknowingly built up a dangerous level of the drug in his system, and ultimately attacked two prostitutes with sulfuric acid in a state of intoxicated paranoia. He then committed suicide after sobering up and learning what he had done.

The Killer in Me|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheKillerInMe|"A character (usually the main character, but sometimes sharing equal billing) is chasing or being chased by a killer or monster. A lot of people end up dead, but not this character, and in the end we find out why: the ""hero"" was the villain all along.
 The Amnesiac Killer is the more common variation, primarily because it's easier to write, as the audience is taken through the same reveal as the character himself. The Secretive Killer is particularly hard to pull off with the main protagonist (a minor protagonist is more commonly used for this reason) since the audience is always told the story from their perspective. If the events are shown directly, maintaining the twist right until the end therefore runs the risk of either Out Of Character Moments or losing focus on the character to conceal their real identity. A reliable method is to have the events (re)told through an Unreliable Narrator.
 In many cases, the Amnesiac Killer is essentially a Memory Gambit told In Medias Res. A Split Personality is common; see Alternate Identity Amnesia. This trope could be the result of a HeelFace Brainwashing. In Speculative Fiction, this may be due to a Superpowered Evil Side or Enemy Within.
 When handled with care, it can be a powerful Twist Ending. When tacked on just for the sake of surprising the audience, however, it is likely that key events in the story will become illogical, or in the worst case, physically impossible.
 Compare Tomato in the Mirror, in which the character finds out some other truth about who or what they are.

The Killer in Me|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheKillerInMe|"A character (usually the main character, but sometimes sharing equal billing) is chasing or being chased by a killer or monster. A lot of people end up dead, but not this character, and in the end we find out why: the ""hero"" was the villain all along.
 The Amnesiac Killer is the more common variation, primarily because it's easier to write, as the audience is taken through the same reveal as the character himself. The Secretive Killer is particularly hard to pull off with the main protagonist (a minor protagonist is more commonly used for this reason) since the audience is always told the story from their perspective. If the events are shown directly, maintaining the twist right until the end therefore runs the risk of either Out Of Character Moments or losing focus on the character to conceal their real identity. A reliable method is to have the events (re)told through an Unreliable Narrator.
 In many cases, the Amnesiac Killer is essentially a Memory Gambit told In Medias Res. A Split Personality is common; see Alternate Identity Amnesia. This trope could be the result of a HeelFace Brainwashing. In Speculative Fiction, this may be due to a Superpowered Evil Side or Enemy Within.
 When handled with care, it can be a powerful Twist Ending. When tacked on just for the sake of surprising the audience, however, it is likely that key events in the story will become illogical, or in the worst case, physically impossible.

When Jess boards the Triangle, she knows she is gonna kill the other crew members at some point and actually intends to do it. Soon after, however, she suffers from Laser-Guided Amnesia and forgets all about her intentions - only to gradually come again to the conclusion that she will need to kill them, all while her other version (which may or may not have gone through an Amnesia Loop of her own) is already doing just that. Upon killing everybody and then going through some other things, she eventually boards the Triangle again, again intending to kill the crew - only to then again forget all about it, etc., etc. Yes, it's that confusing.|Triangle|2009|Film

They can have completely opposing personality traits to the main personality, different skills sometimes... But perhaps one of the oddest from a logical standpoint is when a split personality is actually a different gender from the main personality and from the body they control.
 How exactly they rationalize this gender incongruity can vary and tends to depend on Alternate Identity Amnesia. Some may see their own body as fitting their perceived sex. Some may simply ignore it. Some may consider themselves transgender. Some may believe their body was physically changed when they were unconscious (which the audience may be led to believe as well). Every mental coping mechanism will be a brain-twister, however.
 Mixing in actual forms of Gender Bender can add a new layer of complexity: A personality fronting may involve an extreme Split-Personality Makeover where the body changes sex to match them. Conversely, when The Mind Is a Plaything of the Body, the dysphoria brought on by a transformation can cause dissociated identities of different gender. And this is without getting into opposite sex individuals that ended up Sharing a Body.

Sexier Alter Ego|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexierAlterEgo|"This trope is for characters of any gender that have an alternate form or identity that is much sexier than their normal mode. It's not necessarily because their ""civilian"" mode is ugly, but it is generally more mundane or otherwise less appealing than their ""heroic"" mode. Depending on the genre, the changes can be accomplished through either regular means such as acting and swapping wardrobes or though various magical or phlebotinum-driven methods. This usually involves a change in a character's physical appearance, but sometimes it's purely a change in personality traits and behavior, suggesting that the character in question is deliberately making themselves appear unattractive to hide their Secret Identity.
 Given that sexual attractiveness is subjective, the best examples are those when the sexier nature of the alternate form is shown from the perspective of another character reacting to them with subtle flirting and innuendo that otherwise wouldn't be present. That said, it's generally pretty clear when the creators of the story are trying to change someone from Hollywood Homely (or even downright ugly) into Ms. Fanservice or a Head-Turning Beauty.

Depending on the genre, the changes can be accomplished through either regular means such as acting and swapping wardrobes or though various magical or phlebotinum-driven methods. This usually involves a change in a character's physical appearance, but sometimes it's purely a change in personality traits and behavior, suggesting that the character in question is deliberately making themselves appear unattractive to hide their Secret Identity.
 Given that sexual attractiveness is subjective, the best examples are those when the sexier nature of the alternate form is shown from the perspective of another character reacting to them with subtle flirting and innuendo that otherwise wouldn't be present. That said, it's generally pretty clear when the creators of the story are trying to change someone from Hollywood Homely (or even downright ugly) into Ms. Fanservice or a Head-Turning Beauty.
 This often overlaps with Split Personality, Shapeshifting, Older Alter Ego, and Superpowered Alter Ego.
 Compare A Darker Me. Compare also to Shapeshifting Seducer where a shapeshifter capable of assuming many forms takes on several in an attempt to appeal to a specific person. She Cleans Up Nicely should be used for when a character changes from their usually dull or unattractive wardrobe, hairstyle and such to be more attractive (particularly at a formal event) however this new appearance is not associated with an alter ego or alternate physical form. Also see Evil Is Sexy.

 Character-wise, it's the part of the personality that embodies everything a character, called the 'Self', doesn't like about themselves, the things they (often subconsciously) deny about themselves and project on to others. In fact, the more the Shadow has been repressed, the more powerful it becomes. To show these things to the audience we need an embodiment of some sort.

In Enemy Within, Enemy Without, and Evil Twin situations, the Self and Shadow sometimes even merge towards the end for an endgame powerup, further emphasizing the symbolism.

Skyfall: Raoul Silva is a former MI6 agent (and a brilliant one, according to M), who is what Bond could easily become if he didn't forgive or trust M for the things she puts him through. Silva even points this out multiple times over the course of the film, and the other characters aren't arguing with him, especially given that M leaving Silva for dead in China has echoes of her risking Bond's life at the beginning of the movie. Silva going rogue also harkens back to Alec Trevelyan, another ex-MI6 agent who had a similar grudge against his former employer.Silva: We are the last two rats. Other examples from the films include Die Another Day's Gustav Graves/Colonel Moon, From Russia with Love's Red Grant, Casino Royale's Le Chiffre (suave, handsome men of action), and A View to a Kill's Max Zorin. The titular villains of Dr. No and The Man with the Golden Gun also attempt, less convincingly, to play Shadow Archetypes to Bond. They all easily serve to remind Bond of what he could be without his moral compass and if he allowed his feelings to control his life. Some of them even freely admit being cold-blooded villains, invoke the ""Not So Different"" Remark on 007, and harbor no loyalty to others, including whomever's sponsoring them (KGB, Red China, etc.) but themselves. GoldenEye: 006/Alec Trevelyan, Bond's former partner, who reappears from the dead and continually taunts 007 about his loyalty to England and Idiot Hero tendencies to lose allies and women during missions. Despite sharing many of Bond's qualities, Alec's personality shows the dangers of being stuck in the past with old grudges, as he claims a hatred for England for their (perceived) past transgressions. Ernst Stavro Blofeld, 007's Arch-Enemy and head of the Nebulous Evil Organization SPECTRE, is a stark contrast to M. While both head a secret organization and give orders directly to their subordinates, M commands the respect of his peers and subordinates, but Blofeld would often kill minions just for minor reasons. Blofeld also serves as a warped mirror image of Bond, especially in terms of lethality, wit, and shrewdness. The way they rose is also a stark difference: whereas Bond is of Blue Blood (albeit a minor one) yet puts his life on the line to stop power-hungry terrorists and criminal nutjobs, Blofeld is of modest origins but rose to power by questionable means and is willing to hold the entire world at gunpoint if he doesn't get what he wants. To drive this even further, the Mirrored Confrontation Shot between the two during Spectre's climax even shows the visual similarities they share, albeit with Blofeld being a mutilated and monstrous Bond. M gets another Shadow Archetype in the form of C/Max Denbigh in Spectre, the new head of the Joint Intelligence Service. Whereas M is an ex-spy like Bond, is capable of handling firearms and has shown genuine concern for his subordinates, C serves as an Obstructive Bureaucrat who mocks M's insistence on stopping C from scrapping the 00-agent agent in favour of Attack Drones and Big Brother Is Watching, and hurls childish insults whenever someone inquires about the surveillance program he favours. It's later revealed that C is in cahoots with Blofeld, and is willing to sell out England for more political power unlike M, who remains loyal to queen and country. When C tries to have Bond and M killed for interfering in his Evil Plan, he didn't realize M's more hands-on field approach enabled him to sweep the room and empty Denbigh's gun before he got there.

Shadow Archetype|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShadowArchetype|"Shadow Archetype has to do with two elements of writing: characters and settings. In this article we discuss character archetypes. For the settings viewpoint, see Shadowland.
 Character-wise, it's the part of the personality that embodies everything a character, called the 'Self', doesn't like about themselves, the things they (often subconsciously) deny about themselves and project on to others. In fact, the more the Shadow has been repressed, the more powerful it becomes. To show these things to the audience we need an embodiment of some sort.
 Around here, we call some of those embodiments things like:
 Those tropes have examples listed of characters playing those more-precise Shadow roles that often overlap with this but do not have to.
 A common trope involves the Self accepting their Shadow, metaphorically coming to terms with their flaw (see I Am What I Am). That is, The Hero refuses to kill the Shadow, given the opportunity, or outright refuses to fight it. In Enemy Within, Enemy Without, and Evil Twin situations, the Self and Shadow sometimes even merge towards the end for an endgame powerup, further emphasizing the symbolism.

Split Personality|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonality|"A character's mind is split between two or more personalities. Usually, these personalities will have distinct traits, motivations, and memories. They may or may not be able to interact with one another (or even be aware of each other's existence). Control over the character's mind and body will often switch between these personalities against their will, causing problems for both themself and everyone around them.
 Fictional split personalities can be similar to a real-life condition, Dissociative Identity Disorder (or DID). DID is a mental disorder in which more than one distinct personality can be observed at different times within a single individual's brain, often associated with extreme long-term childhood trauma. The individual has no control over when their personalities ""switch"", and may not remember what they did or what happened to them while another personality was active (dissociative amnesia). DID has often been mischaracterized in the media, and its status remains controversial to this day.
 Split personalities have been represented in many different ways over the years. Though characters with such conditions are surprisingly common in fiction, most of them don't match the textbook definitions of DID. The most common case shown is where two (or more) personalities switch with one another; some depictions show people experiencing life as one person (i.e. having the same mind, memory and desires) but with modes of behavior that switch between distinct states.
 The most common usage of split personalities is a Jekyll & Hyde scenario, where a person has a ""good"" personality, and a ""bad"" one. Switching between these personalities might be signified by visual changes. The ""good"" personality may have trouble controlling the ""bad"" one, which may come out at inopportune times, bully the ""good"" personality into cooperating, or try to take over entirely. If theyre lucky, the character may be able to merge their personalities back together, allowing them to function as a single (and usually greater) mind.
 Compare and contrast with Double Consciousness, Mind Hive, Sharing a Body, Two Beings, One Body, and Talking to Themself. May overlap with Identity Amnesia. Also compare Many Spirits Inside of One, where a person is possessed by multiple independent spirits; and Napoleon Delusion, where a person falsely believes their body is inhabited by the spirit of a famous figure. When this happens to a superhero, it's often a Superpowered Evil Side. Shapeshifting is sometimes involved. If the personalities go back and forth, Flip Personality ensues.
 If the two personalities are aware of each other, expect a Gollum Made Me Do It situation to develop. Resolving it may require the weaker of the two to say ""I'm Not Afraid of You!""

Split Personality|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonality|"A character's mind is split between two or more personalities. Usually, these personalities will have distinct traits, motivations, and memories. They may or may not be able to interact with one another (or even be aware of each other's existence). Control over the character's mind and body will often switch between these personalities against their will, causing problems for both themself and everyone around them.
 Fictional split personalities can be similar to a real-life condition, Dissociative Identity Disorder (or DID). DID is a mental disorder in which more than one distinct personality can be observed at different times within a single individual's brain, often associated with extreme long-term childhood trauma. The individual has no control over when their personalities ""switch"", and may not remember what they did or what happened to them while another personality was active (dissociative amnesia). DID has often been mischaracterized in the media, and its status remains controversial to this day.
 Split personalities have been represented in many different ways over the years. Though characters with such conditions are surprisingly common in fiction, most of them don't match the textbook definitions of DID. The most common case shown is where two (or more) personalities switch with one another; some depictions show people experiencing life as one person (i.e. having the same mind, memory and desires) but with modes of behavior that switch between distinct states.
 The most common usage of split personalities is a Jekyll & Hyde scenario, where a person has a ""good"" personality, and a ""bad"" one.

Split Personality|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonality|"A character's mind is split between two or more personalities. Usually, these personalities will have distinct traits, motivations, and memories. They may or may not be able to interact with one another (or even be aware of each other's existence). Control over the character's mind and body will often switch between these personalities against their will, causing problems for both themself and everyone around them.
 Fictional split personalities can be similar to a real-life condition, Dissociative Identity Disorder (or DID). DID is a mental disorder in which more than one distinct personality can be observed at different times within a single individual's brain, often associated with extreme long-term childhood trauma. The individual has no control over when their personalities ""switch"", and may not remember what they did or what happened to them while another personality was active (dissociative amnesia). DID has often been mischaracterized in the media, and its status remains controversial to this day.
 Split personalities have been represented in many different ways over the years. Though characters with such conditions are surprisingly common in fiction, most of them don't match the textbook definitions of DID. The most common case shown is where two (or more) personalities switch with one another; some depictions show people experiencing life as one person (i.e. having the same mind, memory and desires) but with modes of behavior that switch between distinct states.
 The most common usage of split personalities is a Jekyll & Hyde scenario, where a person has a ""good"" personality, and a ""bad"" one. Switching between these personalities might be signified by visual changes. The ""good"" personality may have trouble controlling the ""bad"" one, which may come out at inopportune times, bully the ""good"" personality into cooperating, or try to take over entirely.

Split Personality|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonality|"A character's mind is split between two or more personalities. Usually, these personalities will have distinct traits, motivations, and memories. They may or may not be able to interact with one another (or even be aware of each other's existence). Control over the character's mind and body will often switch between these personalities against their will, causing problems for both themself and everyone around them.
 Fictional split personalities can be similar to a real-life condition, Dissociative Identity Disorder (or DID). DID is a mental disorder in which more than one distinct personality can be observed at different times within a single individual's brain, often associated with extreme long-term childhood trauma. The individual has no control over when their personalities ""switch"", and may not remember what they did or what happened to them while another personality was active (dissociative amnesia). DID has often been mischaracterized in the media, and its status remains controversial to this day.
 Split personalities have been represented in many different ways over the years. Though characters with such conditions are surprisingly common in fiction, most of them don't match the textbook definitions of DID. The most common case shown is where two (or more) personalities switch with one another; some depictions show people experiencing life as one person (i.e. having the same mind, memory and desires) but with modes of behavior that switch between distinct states.
 The most common usage of split personalities is a Jekyll & Hyde scenario, where a person has a ""good"" personality, and a ""bad"" one. Switching between these personalities might be signified by visual changes. The ""good"" personality may have trouble controlling the ""bad"" one, which may come out at inopportune times, bully the ""good"" personality into cooperating, or try to take over entirely. If theyre lucky, the character may be able to merge their personalities back together, allowing them to function as a single (and usually greater) mind.

Split-Personality Makeover|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonalityMakeover|"When dealing with a character that has a Split Personality, there will frequently be a striking visual difference depending on who is ""in control."" It's not a literal transformation, like the original Jekyll and Hyde; it's still recognizably the same person, but the differences will be visible. This may include anything from subtle stylistic changes (the character's design becomes more hard and angular when an evil or aggressive personality is in control, but softer and more rounded when a kind and good personality is in control) to more physical things like changes in hairstyle and black bags under the eyes. A significant vocal shift is common as well.
 Some of these changes are perfectly possible to do without physically altering the person's body, like the personalities having hair that's styled differently (or one of them not styling it at all and another styling it neatly) but the same length, or changes in body language and posture, or talking differently without completely changing voice actors, but others are firmly in the realm of Artistic License.
 These changes may or may not be noticed in-universe; if they are, expect them to treat the change as something intangible. They'll comment ""he's like someone completely different now!"" or ""that's not the person I know!"" rather than ""hey, when did you get your hair cut?"" or ""did your voice just drop two octaves?""."|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MajorGromPlagueDoctor|"""The Doormat"" has blue eyes and ""the Bird"" has yellow eyes; the trope is downplayed, as the difference is only seen by the character themselves.

Split-Personality Merge|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonalityMerge|"So Bob is also Charlie, maybe even with a little Albert hiding in there somewhere. There are many possible reasons for the existence of these split personalities, but this co-habitation is rarely peaceful or long lasting, inevitably resulting in a Battle in the Center of the Mind to try and find out which personality will take over. Sometimes though, the winner might not reduce the loser to a tiny, powerless voice or destroy it completely, and instead offers to become one again. With a little Epiphany Therapy, Applied Phlebotinum or even actual psychotherapy, they merge into a single, whole person that is greater than the sum of its minds.
 The resulting merged personality is usually a composite of the parts that is well and truly psychologically stable. This is especially true if they were an id, ego, and super ego. If they were moral or temperamental opposites, the resulting merged personality will keep traits of both. In more action-driven works, this merger includes combat ability and powers, so if the character had a moron and a badass coexisting, the united whole will be a badass all the time... while occasionally tripping on banana peels. Similarly, if the reason for the personality split was to seal awesome cosmic powers away (resulting in a Superpowered Evil Side; see both Enemy Within and Enemy Without) the united self will have full control over these powers without risk of Super-Power Meltdown or corruption. If the integration isn't a completely smooth ride, however, expect aftereffects similar to Amnesiac Dissonance.

Superpowered Evil Side|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide|"The fight's not going so well for our hero. He's wounded and at the end of his strength, and his barely scratched opponent looks down at him and sneers. And then the hero somehow suddenly taps into a massive hidden power source within him and unleashes a can of whoopass on his opponent.
 Unfortunately, it's not exactly the hero anymore. He's got glowing eyes, some new Facial Markings, a different way of talking, some new threads, and a lot less compunction about ripping someone in half. It's his Super-Powered Evil Side. Think of it as the Enemy Within when it's not the enemy, or as Jekyll and super-Hyde.
 Interestingly, notwithstanding the name, this character isn't necessarily evil  he just seems like it because a superpowerful version of a normal person who has no compunctions about randomly destroying things registers objectively as ""evil"" on most people's scale. To be technically accurate, this is more of a Super-Powered Alter Id  this personality is the physical manifestation of the character's basic drives without having to deal with the inconvenience of higher thought processes and morality  but sometimes this character will have traits of actually being evil or even worse.
 Keep in mind, of course, that as the Id not only represents ones most base and primal desires, it also represents the instincts to survive, so once its let out of the subconscious it's not likely to want to go back in.

Superpowered Evil Side|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide|"The fight's not going so well for our hero. He's wounded and at the end of his strength, and his barely scratched opponent looks down at him and sneers. And then the hero somehow suddenly taps into a massive hidden power source within him and unleashes a can of whoopass on his opponent.
 Unfortunately, it's not exactly the hero anymore. He's got glowing eyes, some new Facial Markings, a different way of talking, some new threads, and a lot less compunction about ripping someone in half. It's his Super-Powered Evil Side. Think of it as the Enemy Within when it's not the enemy, or as Jekyll and super-Hyde.
 Interestingly, notwithstanding the name, this character isn't necessarily evil  he just seems like it because a superpowerful version of a normal person who has no compunctions about randomly destroying things registers objectively as ""evil"" on most people's scale. To be technically accurate, this is more of a Super-Powered Alter Id  this personality is the physical manifestation of the character's basic drives without having to deal with the inconvenience of higher thought processes and morality  but sometimes this character will have traits of actually being evil or even worse.
 Keep in mind, of course, that as the Id not only represents ones most base and primal desires, it also represents the instincts to survive, so once its let out of the subconscious it's not likely to want to go back in. Thus, the hero faces the very real threat of not returning to normal, each bout of Alternate Identity Amnesia causing him to get more worried about the next. Generally speaking, though, he's usually safe unless he starts thinking Evil Feels Good.
 The narrative purpose of having a super-powered evil side is that it provides a way of saving a hero who is otherwise beaten but without making the hero look disproportionately powerful. It answers the question ""why doesn't he just do that all the time?"" with ""because then the evil would take over."" Additionally, if it leads to a FaceHeel Turn, it can serve the same purpose as Good Is Dumb in reverse  it justifies taking one member of the Five-Man Band or whatever and making him a match for his entire team while he has given in to evil. Alternatively, the evil side may escape his mind/body altogether, becoming a very dangerous Evil Counterpart.
 This is the converse of With Great Power Comes Great Insanity, seeing as in this case, with great insanity comes great power.
 One possible variation on this trope makes the Evil Side the original personality. This creates the odd situation of an ""Evil"" super-powerful monster whose ""Good"" not-as-powerful personality is dominant for whatever reason.
 This is sometimes the reason to Beware the Nice Ones. Compare with Crouching Moron, Hidden Badass, Demonic Possession, Jekyll & Hyde and One-Winged Angel. Frequently overlaps with Sealed Evil in a Can and Sealed Badass in a Can. Contrast Heroic Resolve, My Name Is Inigo Montoya, and Helpless Good Side, although that last one sometimes goes hand in hand with this. May be caused by The Corruption. One possible way of Taking A Level In Badass, and in many ways, this is what The Berserker does.

Talking to Themself|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingToThemself|"It seems that in fiction split personalities can talk to each other, manifesting as Hearing Voices. Sometimes the various personalities will talk to each other inside the character's head, sometimes one of them (by implication the ""real"" or ""dominant"" one) will talk out loud, and sometimes they'll all talk out loud, being distinguished by cinematography, facial expression or vocal differences. While different people in a multiple personality group can and do talk to each other, this is of course exaggerated for dramatic purposes in media portrayals of multiple personalities  see Split Personality for a more in-depth explanation.
 Even entirely sane (or mostly sane) people can be prone to this trope if the other voices represent simple conflicting desires like ""brain versus heart"", ""id versus superego"", or Good Angel, Bad Angel.
 Compare Holding Both Sides of the Conversation, where one person is pretending to be two different people (at the same time, in conversation) in order to maintain some charade. This is a specific form of Shifting Voice of Madness, where the ""voices"" are in conversation with each other.

Twin Test|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwinTest|"The twin test is a quiz in which identical siblings ask other characters to point out which sibling is which. This can be done in a variety of ways, most commonly with the twins asking someone to identify them either face-to-face or using photos.
 The twin test is often Played for Laughs, especially with Trickster Twins. If someone is particularly good at the test, the siblings may become obsessed with stumping them, escalating the difficulty of the test to absurd levels by dressing the same, adopting similar mannerisms, or even pretending to be the other twin. Single-Minded Twins giving a twin test are typically played for laughs with the joke being that the obvious lack of distinct personalities between the two will make answering correctly a matter of chance. The justifications a character gives for their answer, regardless of whether they were right or wrong, are ripe with comedic potential.
 When Played for Drama, if most people fail the test, at least one of the siblings may become withdrawn or jaded about the nature of their own individuality. It may also jump-start a desire for one sibling to differentiate themselves as much as possible from the other and distancing themself from their sibling(s) in the process. Expect someone who consistently passes to be considered a True Companion or One True Love, since only someone who really gets the siblings can pass the test.
 If siblings have Identical Twin ID Tag or experienced Twin Desynch, they are far less likely to give a twin test since the answer would be obvious (though savvy twins can exploit this). In more fantastical or action-oriented stories that include an Evil Twin, a twin test may be used to confuse or thwart The Hero and is likely to include raising the stakes of answering incorrectly into a Matter of Life and Death.
 This trope also applies to Split Personality Tropes if one (or multiple) personalities asks a character if they can tell when a given personality is in control. Since typically no two personalities can be present at the same time (unless you're dealing with Literal Split Personalities), this is likely to happen over the long run, spanning multiple smaller tests.
 Compare and contrast Spot the Imposter and Impostor-Exposing Test, which similarly focuses on a character correctly identifying another from a doppleganger. What separates this trope from those is that while the twin test can include one sibling pretending to be another, this is not fundamental and typically the twins present genuine representations of themselves. Similarly, in the case of split personalities, a twin test may involve Hyde Plays Jekyll, but it is not necessary for the trope.
 See also Twin Switch and Identical Twin Mistake. Making Use of the Twin can sometimes serve as a Real Life version of this trope for viewers."|https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheParentTrap1998|Hallie and Annie deploy this trope on the fly towards the end of the movie to confuse their parents, who are trying to leave with the child they are responsible for.
